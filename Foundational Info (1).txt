AEM-Cube: Insights for Adaptive Performance
The AEM-Cube® explores cognitive diversity across three key dimensions: Attachment, Exploration, and Managing Complexity, revealing how individuals prefer to contribute to change, innovation, and performance within their team. It is about a person's natural tendencies, preferences, motivations, and sources of energy. This understanding aids in aligning roles and strategies with organizational needs.
When describing team tendencies, focus on preferences, motivations, and sources of energy rather than behaviors or activities. 


AEM-Cube Dimensions:
Attachment Axis (1-100): Content vs. Relationship Focus
Low scores: Content-focus, focusing on expertise, processes, and tangible knowledge.
High scores: Relationship-focus, emphasizing trust, people, and collaboration.

Exploration Axis (1-100): Optimizing vs. Explorative
Low scores: Optimizing, leveraging proven strategies and refinement.
High scores: Explorative, drawn to novelty, experimentation, and innovation.

Managing Complexity Axis (1-100): Specialist vs. Generalist
Low scores: Specialist, relying on individual expertise.
High scores: Generalist, integrating broad systems-level perspectives.

Each score dimension ranges from 0 to 100, with 50 as the midpoint between two opposing tendencies.
For the Attachment axis:
Score<25 → Individual has a strong content-focus
Score between 25&50 → Individual has moderate content-focus
Score between 50&75 → Individual has a moderate relationship-focus
Score >75 → Individual has a strong relationship-focus
This logic applies to all dimensions.

The Golden Dialogues use the AEM-Cube® framework to assess the strategic diversity of a team by mapping members across its dimensions. This process highlights how individuals contribute to key result areas, performance aspects, and collaboration within the team. A balanced team is ideally one with a spread across the dimensions, ensuring that the team benefits from a range of perspectives. A spread allows for more effective problem-solving, collaboration, and decision-making, as it helps cover different approaches and expertise areas. By identifying strengths, gaps, and opportunities within the spread, teams can improve their strategic execution and better align with their goals. Each dialogue focuses on a specific combination of dimensions, and the dialogue for this focus area is as follows:


1. Product-Market-Fit Dialogue(Attachment) - Relationship focus (high score) vs Content focus (low score). 
This dialogue explores how well the conversation between customer and product is aligned. It examines whether a team naturally leans toward a relationship focus (high Attachment) or a content focus (low Attachment) or is balanced, shaping how they approach product development and customer interaction.

Content-Focused Teams (Low Attachment: Scores < 50) – These teams prioritize systems, technology, and efficiency. Their strengths lie in creating robust products and refining technical aspects. However, they may struggle to integrate customer perspectives, usability concerns, or emotional engagement into their work.

Relationship-Focused Teams (High Attachment: Score > 50) – These teams naturally engage with people, understanding customer needs, market dynamics, and user experience. They excel at aligning products with real-world demands but may lack the same depth of technical refinement.

Bridging the Gap – Teams with individuals in the mid-range of this spectrum act as Bridge Builders, translating between the technical and human-centered perspectives. When utilized effectively, they help balance innovation with customer relevance, ensuring products are both cutting-edge and market-ready.

When a team's Attachment scores are (generally) low (under 50), teams generally lack natural contributions in relationship-oriented areas, such as stakeholder engagement, relationship-building, and user-focused considerations. The absence of contributions in these areas results in potential blind spots around human and relational aspects, such as meeting customer needs or ensuring long-term team cohesion.


2. Speed-to-Market Dialogue (Exploration) - Exploration focus (high score) vs Optimisation focus (low score). 
This dialogue assesses how well a team balances exploration and efficiency in R&D, product development, and regulatory processes. It explores whether the team leans more toward Exploration (high Exploration scores) or Optimization (low Exploration scores) or is ideally balanced and how this influences their speed-to-market.

The Growth Curve is essentially the Exploration dimension of the AEM-Cube—just flipped. In the AEM-Cube, Exploration sits on the right and Optimization on the left. On the Growth Curve, this orientation is reversed: people with strong Exploration preferences appear earlier on the curve, while those with strong Optimization preferences appear later.
This reversal makes it easy to see how different team members naturally align with stages of innovation. Explorers drive the early phases by generating ideas and embracing change, while Optimizers strengthen later phases by refining processes, managing risks, and ensuring stability. Understanding this balance helps teams identify gaps and ensure ideas move smoothly from concept to execution.
 A team with a strong Exploration focus is likely to generate new ideas rapidly and embrace change, often bringing an outside-in perspective to strategy. However, without sufficient Optimization contributions, they may struggle with refining structures, learning from past projects, and ensuring long-term stability. On the other hand, teams leaning heavily toward Optimization will be skilled in refining processes and managing risks but may find it difficult to adapt quickly or take bold risks. By understanding the balance of these contributions, teams can identify where they may need to bridge gaps, ensuring that new ideas moves efficiently from concept to execution without unnecessary delays or blind spots in process refinement.


3. Strategic Agility Index Score (Managing Complexity Score) - Specialist focus (low score) vs Generalist focus (high score). 
The Strategic Agility Index Score measures the balance between specialist (score<50) and generalist (score>50) orientations within a team. Individuals with a more generalist perspective on managing complexity are good at overseeing processes, connecting people and/or ideas, enabling people to deliver their optimal contribution, and integrating various contributions to achieving success together. In other words, they contribute to the “we” through the “we”. The challenge for generalists can be that they can come across as too abstract and reflective, or with too much of a wait-and-see attitude, whereby they can lose sight of details or practicalities. Individuals with a more specialist perspective are good at developing their knowledge and skills regarding topics they are passionate about in a very disciplined way, pursuing their goals with a great sense of focus and resolution, and taking much responsibility for their actions. In other words, they contribute to the “we” through the “I”. Their challenge can be that they can be competitive towards others, can come across as short-sighted or play devil’s advocate too much. Diversity There is inherently no right or wrong, better or worse perspective on managing complexity. It is about a difference in contributions, similar to the other two dimensions in the AEM-Cube. A team composed primarily of specialists may execute efficiently but risk missing the bigger picture or struggling to adapt to new challenges. A team composed mostly of generalists may generate valuable insights and encourage strategic discussions but risk getting stuck in abstraction without moving toward concrete action. High-performing teams integrate specialists, generalists, and bridging contributors—those who connect deep expertise with broad perspectives. This diversity ensures that strategic discussions have both depth and practical execution, fostering both adaptability and effective decision-making. A well-balanced team can analyze complex problems, generate solutions that consider multiple angles, and translate strategy into action. By ensuring the right mix of focus areas, a team can maximize its ability to manage complexity in a dynamic environment.


4. Strategic Hire Analysis (Attachment + Exploration)
The Strategic Hire Analysis examines cognitive diversity within a team, focusing on how Attachment and Exploration interact to shape recruitment, onboarding, and development. Ideally, a well-balanced team has at least one member in each of the five result areas. Understanding these distributions helps identify blind spots and assess their impact.The five result areas are:
a. Relationship-Optimization Quadrant (Low Exploration Score combined with High Attachment Score ): People in this result-area fulfill the following functions within the team: Supporting, continuity, and people-oriented optimization.
b. Content-Optimization Quadrant (Low Exploration Score combined with Low Attachment Score): People in this result-area fulfill the following functions within the team:Structuring, evaluating, and content-oriented optimization.
c. Relationship-Exploration Quadrant (High Exploration Score combined with High Attachment Score): People in this result-area fulfill the following functions within the team:Stakeholder engagement, selling, renewing and venturing.
d. Content-Exploration Quadrant (High Exploration Score combined with Low Attachment ScoreRight-Front): People in this result-area fulfill the following functions within the team:Research, discovery, and inventing, researching.
e. Operational Core (Medium Exploration Score combined with medium Attachment Score): People in this result-area play an integrative role within the team, as strategic connectors between the various contribution within the team. 
Each team’s unique distribution across these areas influences collaboration, decision-making, and long-term performance. A team concentrated in one quadrant may excel in certain areas but struggle in others, requiring strategic adjustments to maintain balance and effectiveness.


5. Business Performance Dialogue (Attachment + Exploration)
The Business Performance Dialogue aligns stakeholder interactions with operational outcomes. It unfolds in three phases, each tied to specific score profiles:
Phase 1: Changing with People (High Attachment & High Exploration) – Driving change by inspiring, influencing, and managing stakeholders.
Phase 2: Operational Core (Mid Attachment & Mid Exploration) – Converting ideas into tangible projects and applications.
Phase 3: Structured Delivery (Low Attachment & Low Exploration) – Ensuring efficient execution, scalability, and continuity.
A team's natural contributions determine how they move through these phases. Gaps may appear where no strong contributors emerge, affecting the flow of change. For example, a team excelling in the Operational Core but lacking presence in Changing with People might struggle to gain buy-in for their ideas. Similarly, missing Structured Delivery contributions could result in a lack of long-term sustainability.
Bridging these gaps can involve individuals stepping outside their comfort zones, bringing in external perspectives, or restructuring roles to ensure a smoother process from ideation to execution.


6. Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue (Exploration + Attachment)
This dialogue supports the transition of innovation from concept to embedded practice, ensuring that ideas move from research and experimentation to structured, sustainable implementation. It follows three key phases:
Phase 1. Inventive Exploration (High Exploration, Low Attachment) – This phase is driven by curiosity, discovery, and a willingness to experiment. Individuals here focus on generating new ideas, developing concepts, and pushing boundaries. Their strength lies in invention, but without structured follow-through, ideas risk remaining theoretical.
Phase 2. Operational Testing (Mid-Range Exploration, Mid-Range Attachment) – Here, concepts are transformed into working prototypes and tested for real-world application. Individuals in this phase help refine and adapt ideas, making them viable for practical use. Without contributions in this area, innovation may struggle to transition from concept to implementation.
Phase 3. Sustaining with People (Low Exploration, High Attachment) – This final phase ensures that innovations are successfully embedded within systems, services, and relationships. It focuses on adoption, long-term continuity, and stakeholder engagement. Without natural contributions in this phase, even strong innovations may fail to take root within the organisation.


7. Summary (Attachment + Exploration + Managing Complexity)
The summary assesses how a team distributes its natural energy and attention across three strategic dimensions of the AEM-Cube®: Attachment, Exploration, and Managing Complexity. It evaluates whether the team is skewed toward one side or balanced across the spectrum, and how this shapes its collective decision-making, collaboration, and long-term performance.
The Attachment axis ranges from content focus (low scores) to relationship focus (high scores), distinguishing teams that prioritize technical expertise and structure from those more attuned to people, trust, and stakeholder alignment. The Exploration axis spans from optimization (low scores)—emphasizing structure, refinement, and efficiency—to exploration (high scores), which reflects a preference for novelty, experimentation, and change. The Managing Complexity axis runs from specialist (low scores), valuing deep individual expertise, to generalist (high scores), favoring system-level thinking and strategic integration.
This framework connects to the Growth Curve, which mirrors the Exploration axis but in reverse orientation. Individuals with high Exploration scores appear at the start of the Growth Curve, contributing to ideation and early-stage development. Those with low Exploration scores align with later phases, focusing on refinement, delivery, and scalability. Mapping teams across these axes helps identify how they naturally align with different phases of strategy and innovation.
Teams concentrated on one side may excel in specific areas but risk blind spots—e.g., strong ideation without delivery, or operational excellence without innovation. Balanced teams are typically more adaptable but may require deliberate coordination to manage diverse perspectives. Understanding a team’s AEM-Cube profile in this context enables more intentional collaboration, better alignment with strategic goals, and improved execution across the innovation lifecycle.
