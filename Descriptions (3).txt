Project: Berry
Focus: Summary
Description: This profile reflects a strategically diverse team capable of combining deep subject-matter expertise with commercial, managerial, and change management skills. On the content level, this team can tackle the entire process of innovation, upscaling, operations, and quality control. The diversity on the relationship side is mainly focused on exploring and developing new relationships. The team is capable of operating on the relational aspect—for example, with customers or partners—but less so in terms of service and support. This is evident from the lack of people in the optimization-people-focus quadrant. This is a team that tends to focus more on the bigger picture and maintaining an overview. There are a few more specialist-oriented team members who can contribute to keeping the team practically and energetically focused on results. This is a team that is dynamic and will remain dynamic, and is difficult to bureaucratize. As a team, it fits within the dynamic that is especially suited to the phase of innovation and upscaling to operations—regardless of the product or service involved.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: This group boasts a rich cognitive mix on the Attachment dimension — around half demonstrate a strong inclination towards relationships, attentively considering market/customer needs and usability. They raise pivotal questions such as: Are our products/services meeting people's needs? Will they find them useful? How can we enhance usability? The other half exhibits a natural content focus; constantly exploring possibilities for creation, innovation, and system efficiency. They delve into technological feasibility and strive to make continuous improvements. Connecting these two factions are the 'Bridge Builders,' individuals who effortlessly navigate both perspectives. They hold the potential to foster mutual understanding and act as key players in translating ideas between the two ends of the spectrum. This crucial role is currently the least occupied within this group, but it's not a cause for alarm. However, leveraging the skills of these 'Bridge Builders' presents a golden opportunity for constructive dialogue. Failing to recognize their value risks creating a conflict-ridden dynamic within the group, potentially leading to unconscious division into two opposing factions.

Focus: Speed-to-Market 
Description: This group exhibits diverse positions across the entire Exploration dimension, with natural contributions throughout every stage of the Growth-Curve. Approximately 75% of the individuals naturally lean towards the first half of the Growth-Curve, particularly in the Explorative-Operational phase. This suggests a group inclined towards an outside-in perspective, generating new ideas and strategizing around them. They are dynamic and eager to witness tangible changes, actively contributing wherever possible. On the other hand, the Optimizing contributions (second half of the Curve) are less prevalent but evenly distributed within the group. This presents both an opportunity for a constructive dialogue and a potential risk for those with less representation to feel misunderstood. Consequently, some may conform to the explorative culture, leading to the loss of their valuable insights, or an unconscious formation of a conflict dimension, inadvertently creating an in-group out-group dynamic.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This group exhibits a favourable cognitive blend on the Managing Complexity dimension, with a slight inclination towards a Generalist attitude. This indicates their ability to approach complex problems, challenges and situations from a broad, integrating standpoint, instinctively considering diverse perspectives and perceiving them from multiple angles before reaching decisions. This broad perspective allows them to oversee more of the Growth-Curve, facilitating productive dialogues across various areas. However, an overemphasis on generalist thinking may lead to prolonged decision-making processes, bogged down with too much dialogue and reflection as they can become absorbed in complex analyses. To complement this, the group benefits from individuals with a more Specialist attitude, who excel in analysing problems from a focused, expertise driven and in-depth standpoint. Their valuable ability to analyse complicated challenges and solve specific problems is essential for efficient decision-making. Presently, the group is quite diverse but few more highly specialist contributions could significantly deepen the strategic dialogue and enhance the group's effectiveness.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: When examining the combination of the Attachment dimension and the Exploration dimension, we can identify five distinct result areas. This group exhibits a well-distributed spread across three quadrants, encompassing approximately 75% of the Cube. Clearly, three contribution groups are forming, each occupying a different quadrant. This presents a golden opportunity to foster dialogues that yield the best results. However, there is one quadrant—the Relationship-Optimization quadrant that lacks natural contributions within this specific group. This quadrant is crucial for "making things stick with people," involving aspects such as supporting the business, delivering excellent service for customers and employees, managing long-term relationships, and ensuring group cohesion. Though not always considered during change discussions, this contribution is vital for successful implementation of new changes, transformations, or mergers within the organization. The relevance of this possible blind spot depends on the context and the team's current needs. The middle area is identified as the Operational Core, where all other contributions converge. When harnessed effectively, these individuals become the strategic connectors, facilitating dialogues between Relationship and Content throughout the entire Growth-Curve. While this team may currently have some room for improvement in this area, they do possess the potential to stretch and fill this crucial role

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This group demonstrates a well-distributed contribution along the Business Performance Dialogue, creating a conducive environment to excel in projects related to this domain. The contributions naturally go from "changing with people," making them adept at stakeholder management, selling ideas to the business, and inspiring people to embrace change, to focusing on solidifying changes into business processes, systems, and long-term structures. Together they foster a "You ask, we deliver" attitude that enhances their project performance. When examining the group dynamics closer, we notice a potential hiccup in this dialogue. The Bridge Builder position, which connects the first and third phases, is missing. This creates a risk for group fragmentation, reduced understanding, and possible conflicts. The diagonal dialogues, where no dimensions are shared between groups, have even higher potential for conflict emergence. Nevertheless, when managed skillfully and with care, these dialogues are the most intriguing, as they complement each other's cognitive styles harmoniously. Although the gap in this group is not extreme, it's essential to be mindful of this aspect.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This group exhibits some gaps in the distribution along the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, which involves protecting and nurturing innovative ideas, practices, and initiatives within an organization. We can observe distinct natural contributions at the beginning of this dialogue, embracing change from an inventive and research-oriented perspective. These contributions play a vital role in initiating the invention phase of the dialogue, especially concerning product development. To fully harness these contributions, the organization should establish a sandbox environment where experimentation is encouraged. As we progress through the dialogue, we encounter a relatively extensive area where this group lacks clear natural contributions. While other contributions are not positioned too far away and can potentially stretch to support the formation of this dialogue temporarily, the absence of natural contributions from a Relationship-Optimisation standpoint, as discussed earlier, could impact the successful introduction and long-term integration of new products within the organization. Whether this aspect is relevant for this group depends on their strategic goals and result areas.


Project: JCDO
Focus: Summary
Description: This team has a highly specialized strategic diversity. It is positioned almost entirely at the extreme content-focused edge of the AEM-Cube. This is a team that operates with strong professional expertise and interacts based on content—knowing, valuing, and holding each other accountable on that basis. This content is often technical, digital, or focused on all aspects of financial or legal governance and quality assurance, but it can also apply to domains like the arts. Whatever the content theme may be in this team, the members are capable of handling it from ideation to execution. It is highly uncertain whether this team can develop solutions that consistently align with external needs. In a team like this, the product always takes precedence, while the customer comes second. The team's commercial abilities may be questionable. However, if this team is integrated into an organization that can take over the responsibilities it is less strong in, it can achieve remarkable results thanks to its extreme specialization. Two team members are more operationally oriented on the people side. Typically, in a distribution like this, such members have a significant impact on how the team functions. In many cases, individuals in this position are involved in support and assistance roles. The fact that one of them demonstrates a high level of generalization—and thus likely understands the team’s dynamics and needs—can help create favorable conditions and aid in conflict de-escalation. This role could become the informal right hand of the team leader, ensuring internal cohesion and alignment with the external environment.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: This group displays a clear cognitive preference for the content-focused aspect of the Attachment dimension. This natural inclination toward content (things, matter, systems) results in a team that constantly explores possibilities for creation, invention, and system efficiency. They delve into technological feasibility and strive for continuous improvements. Products and services developed by this team are likely to be technologically robust and innovative. However, a significant gap emerges on the relationship-focused side of this dimension. The absence of individuals naturally inclined toward this aspect leaves the team vulnerable to neglecting the 'people perspective' in their projects and products, such as carefully considering market and customer needs and usability. They might overlook crucial questions like: Are our products/services meeting people's needs? Will users find them useful? How can we improve usability? Additionally, they may neglect subtle group interactions, such as ensuring everyone is heard during meetings. This oversight can lead to missed insights and perspectives from team members. There are two individuals in the middle, the 'Bridge Builders’, who play a vital role in fostering mutual understanding and act as key translators between the two ends of the spectrum. This contribution should be recognized and leveraged effectively. Ideally, these individuals would stretch toward the relationship side to bring that perspective more into the group. Even better, the team should enable them to act as a bridge between this team and other teams or stakeholders within the organisation

Focus: Speed-to-Market 
Description: This group exhibits diverse positions across the entire Exploration dimension, with natural contributions at almost every stage of the Growth-Curve. Approximately 70% of the individuals naturally lean towards the operational core, particularly in the Explorative-Operational phase. This orientation suggests a group inclined towards an outside-in perspective, generating new ideas and strategising around them. They are dynamic and eager to see tangible changes, actively contributing wherever possible. There will likely be no shortage of new ideas when this group gathers, and opportunities are welcomed with open arms. Due to their operational nature, they might struggle with taking a step back after a project to celebrate successes and learn from the process for future improvements. Optimising contributions (second half of the Curve) are less prevalent within the group — there is only one individual who naturally contributes in this area. This presents a potential risk for the group to overlook the critical questions that need to be asked to prevent technical errors, establish necessary structures, and finish products or projects to the highest standards. Furthermore, building and improving on existing foundations (an inside-out perspective on change) may not be a priority for the group. It will be crucial to emphasize the importance of these optimization contributions, and perhaps find ways to ensure this phase is not forgotten or undervalued in the projects this group undertakes, or worse, placed solely on the shoulders of the individual who contributes in this area.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This group exhibits good diversity on the Managing Complexity dimension, with a slight skewness towards a Generalist attitude. This indicates a preference for focusing on complex challenges with broad, overarching and integrative perspective, naturally considering diverse perspectives and approaching them from multiple angles before forming conclusions. This broad perspective allows them to oversee more of the Growth-Curve, facilitating productive dialogues across various areas. However, an overemphasis on generalist thinking may slow down communication and cooperation if they get stuck in too much reflection and dialogue. To avoid this from happening, the group benefits from individuals with a more Specialist attitude, who excel in analysing problems with a more focused, expertise driven and in-depth persecptive. Their valuable ability to analyse complicated challenges and solve in-depth problems is essential for making the right decisions and executing on them optimally. As is, the group is already very diverse but few more highly specialist contributions could significantly deepen the strategic dialogue and enhance the group's effectiveness. Effective communication and understanding between team members will become even more important, however.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: When examining the combination of the Attachment and Exploration dimensions, we identify five distinct result areas. This group primarily clusters in the explorative-content quadrant, indicating a focus on researching and developing new technologies, theories, and systems. However, their penchant for invention may lead to changes made just for the sake of change. They should be aware of when to use this contribution, and when they need to listen to the other quadrants. The group's fewer contributions in the optimising-content quadrant might result in energy lapses during later Growth-Curve phases, leading to potential blind spots in solidifying long-term systems and a lack of detail orientation. In the Explorative-relationship quadrant, essential for engaging with stakeholders, the group's prowess in invention could face challenges in appealing to non-content focused individuals. The impact of this blind spot varies based on the team's objectives. The Optimisation-relationship quadrant is underrepresented in this group but crucial for sustaining changes and ensuring service excellence, long-term relationships, and group cohesion. This contribution is vital for successful organisational transformations, with its relevance also dependent on specific goals. The Operation Core is where all contributions converge. If effectively leveraged, individuals here act as strategic connectors across the Growth-Curve. Despite some existing gaps, the team has potential to enhance its role in this crucial area with the two contributions close to this area. 

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This group shows a two-area-occupied contribution along the Business Performance Dialogue. There are no natural contributions at the start of this dialogue, which focuses on ‘changing with people’, stakeholder management, selling ideas to the business, and inspiring people to embrace change. However, as we progress through the dialogue, we find natural contributions in the operational core, which focuses on translating these previously sold ideas into practical frameworks, projects, and applications. Further along, we encounter a second gap where these practical operations should be turned into structured solutions and templates. The process concludes with few, yet effective contributions, ensuring that changes are solidified into business processes, systems, and long-term structures. Together, these positions foster a "You ask, we deliver" attitude that enhances the group's project performance. The group could benefit from examining if they notice these hiccups in practice and exploring creative solutions to bridge these gaps where they may be hindering progress. It could be that individuals are prepared to, on occasion, stretch towards the gaps. Alternatively, other people within or outside the organisation, who do have these natural contributions, could be flown in to provide their perspective on critical moments. Lastly, one could look at filling these positions more permanent for the long term. 

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This group exhibits some gaps in the distribution along the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, which involves protecting and nurturing innovative ideas, practices, and initiatives within an organisation. We can observe distinct natural contributions at the beginning of this dialogue, embracing change from an inventive and research-oriented perspective. These contributions play a vital role in initiating the invention phase of the dialogue, especially concerning product development. To fully harness these contributions, the organisation should establish a sandbox environment where experimentation is encouraged, and intelligent failure is allowed. As we progress through the dialogue, we encounter the first area where this group lacks clear natural contributions. While other contributions are not positioned too far away and can potentially stretch to support the formation of this dialogue temporarily, the absence of natural contributions from a Relationship-Optimisation standpoint, as discussed earlier, could impact the successful introduction and long-term integration of new products within the organisation. Whether this aspect is relevant for this group depends on their strategic goals and result areas.


Project: RVB_BPF_Waterbouw
Focus: Summary
Description: This team covers the entire Attachment dimension from to content to relationships. All five team members are spread out near perfectly along this dimension, creating the basis for a very strong product-client dialogue. There might be a small majority of contributions on the content side which could put a small emphasis on data, models and rational arguments in the strategic dialogue within the group, overall this will be pretty much negligible: this group will be able to cover both the product and process side of the team’s strategy as well as paying ample attention to the clients and employees. If the team has a clear outspoken need for one or the other (for instance, an R&D team that needs to focus more on content or a customer service team that needs to emphasize clients) this do-it-all set-up can be a distractor but if the team needs to facilitate a strategic dialogue that does both this diversity fits very well. Along with the Attachment dimension, the Exploration dimension is also near perfectly spread out, allowing the team to move very efficiently from thinking out of the box, generating new ideas and launching new initiatives to operationalizing them and finally to implementing and optimizing them. There will not be one area of focus that dominates or overshadows the others in the team’s dialogue and there are no areas left uncovered; every aspect of the Exploration dimension (and thus the Growth-Curve) is covered equally. Like with the Attachment dimension, there are teams that benefit from a clear outspoken focus on either area of this dimension (an R&D team that needs to emphasize exploration or a financial control team that needs to focus on optimization); if this is one of those it might benefit from more contributions in that area. If it is not, however, and it needs to be able to move from exploration to optimization, then this team is very well set-up along the Exploration dimension. Looking at both dimensions, this group is able to cover most different result areas but, given the empty left back and right front quadrants, customer service and technical innovation might not be the team’s top priorities. Finally, when it comes to the Managing Complexity dimension, there is not really a lot of diversity. The majority of contributions fall around the middle on this dimension (either slightly above or slightly below) which could lead to a rather one-sided and/or superficial strategic dialogue. The one more generalist voice can help to keep the entire process in mind, to integrate ideas and to discuss the more strategic aspects of the team’s priorities. However, there are no true specialists; these might really help with introducing specific expertise, going deeper into details and bringing additional energy and contrasting viewpoints into the dialogue and cooperation. Adding a bit more variety into this group on the Managing Complexity dimension will deepen the way this team discusses strategy and the way it deals with unexpected and complex challenges.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit  
Description: This group exhibits a cognitive preference for the mid-content-oriented aspect of the Attachment dimension. This natural tendency results in a team that consistently explores opportunities for system efficiency. They delve into technological and systematic feasibility and strive for continuous improvement. The products, services, and solutions developed by this team are likely to be technically robust and reliable. Additionally, they aim to connect these content-driven improvements with the various departments, people, and parties within the organization, a trait that emerges from the cognitive contribution in the middle of this dimension. They are likely strong in translating their content-related improvements into different perspectives within the organization. However, there is a weaker contribution to the relationship-oriented side of this dimension. The absence of individuals who are naturally inclined towards this aspect makes the team vulnerable to neglecting the 'human perspective' in their projects and products, such as carefully considering market and customer needs. They might overlook crucial questions such as: Do our products/services meet people's needs? Will they find them useful? How can we improve usability? Furthermore, they may ignore subtle group dynamics, like ensuring everyone is heard during meetings. This shortcoming can lead to missed insights and perspectives from team members or external parties. 

Focus: Speed-to-Market 
Description: The group demonstrates strong cognitive engagement across almost the entire Growth Curve, with a focus weighted toward the second half (optimization). This orientation suggests a group inclined toward an inside-out perspective, naturally asking critical questions to prevent technical errors, establish necessary structures, and complete products or projects to the highest standards. Additionally, the group prioritizes building and improving existing foundations. The operational core ensures that, when provided with the right frameworks, they can translate efforts into a (strategically) practical approach. Exploratory contributions are less prevalent within the group — only one individual naturally contributes in this area. This poses a potential risk, as the outside-in perspective, which involves generating new ideas and forming strategies around them, may be overlooked. If the group can leverage these natural contributions during the first half of the Growth Curve, they will be capable of delivering from ‘strategy’ to ‘completion.’ 

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This group exhibits a relatively diverse cognitive mix on this dimension, with a clear tendency toward a moderately specialist perspective. This indicates their initial inclination to analyze issues from a specific and in-depth perspective. Their valuable capability to unravel complicated challenges and arrive at solutions is essential for going in-depth problem-solving, bringing specific areas of expertise and experience to the table and making sure there is a healthy focus on details and execution. When they can effectively translate their insights to the more generalist individuals in the group, the team has the potential to incorporate these complex perspectives into their decision-making processes. Such contributions are crucial for deepening the strategic dialogue and bridging diverse interests, needs, and viewpoints when addressing challenges within and outside the organization.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: When examining the combination of the Attachment and Exploration dimensions, we identify five distinct result areas. This group demonstrates a clear natural distribution across two quadrants: the content-optimisation and the explorative-relationship quadrant. The other two quadrants - the optimisation-relationship and exploration-content are empty. The optimization-content quadrant contributes to consolidating long-term systems, focusing on details, and critically evaluating new ideas and inventions. The explorative-relationship quadrant is essential for engaging stakeholders and “selling” ideas to various people and stakeholders. The missing optimization-relationship quadrant is critical for sustaining change and ensuring service excellence, long-term relationships, and group cohesion. The absence of natural contributions here may lead to less attention being paid to these aspects both within and outside the team. The missing explorative-content quadrant suggests that the team is less naturally inclined to explore and develop new technologies, theories, and systems, or to respond to new content-related developments (e.g., Artificial Intelligence). The Operational Core is where all contributions converge. If utilized effectively, individuals in this zone can act as strategic connectors across the entire Growth Curve. While there are not many clear natural contributions in this zone, it is not a significant stretch for several individuals whose contributions are situated near this area.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This group naturally has an almost complete presence in the Business Performance Dialogue. They are capable of transitioning from "driving change with people," which makes them skilled in practical stakeholder management and effectively selling ideas within the organization, to focusing on embedding changes into business processes, systems, and long-term structures. Together, they foster a "You ask, we deliver" attitude that enhances their project performance. To fully optimize this dialogue, the group could explore ways to integrate the initial phase of this dialogue as well. This phase involves inspiring others to embrace change and translating external stakeholder needs and ideas into the internal conversation. This can be achieved by either bringing in someone external to the group who naturally contributes in this area on a situational basis or by encouraging certain individuals within the group to consciously make the stretch when needed.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This group exhibits two significant gaps in their distribution along the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, which involves protecting and nurturing inventive ideas, practices, and initiatives within an organization. We observe no clear natural contributions to the first half of this dialogue, which focuses on embracing change through an inventive and research-oriented approach. These contributions are critical for initiating the invention phase of the dialogue, particularly in relation to product development. Further along the dialogue, we see one natural contribution that leans toward the operational aspect, where tendencies to test substantive inventions and develop prototypes often emerge. Whether these aspects are relevant for this group depends on their strategic goals and desired outcomes. At the end of the dialogue, we again observe no natural contributions tied to the relationship-optimization perspective. This contribution is crucial for “sustaining changes with people” and includes aspects such as supporting employees, delivering excellent service for both customers and staff, managing long-term relationships, and ensuring group cohesion. Although this aspect is not always considered in discussions about change, it is vital for the successful implementation of new changes, transformations, or mergers within the organization.


Project: RVT_BPF_Waterbouw
Focus: Summary
Description: Looking at the Attachment dimension, this team is predominantly focused on people over content. This implies a team that puts a lot of attention on clients, employees and other stakeholders and will often prioritize their needs over other strategic priorities that might pop up. Their is also a contribution on the content side, however, indicating that the relevant data, concepts, products, processes, etc. will not be overlooked. These will absolutely be heard but they might not always be the main focus or the number one priority in this team. The biggest challenge for this team will be the large gap that exists between the content-focused contribution and the more relationship-focused contributions: this could lead to polarization, misunderstandings and friction between the two perceptions, especially if the group is put under pressure. However, if the team members can bridge this gap and keep listening to each other, they can have a healthy product-client dialogue. Looking at the Exploration dimension, this team is reasonably spread out, albeit with a slightly bigger focus on the optimization side of things. With the majority of contributions on the optimization halve of the Exploration dimension and a sizable gap between them and the sole exploratory contribution, this latter voice might not get the attention it needs and it might be lost in the mix. In essence this group should be able to move effectively from exploration (generating ideas, thinking out of the box, starting new projects, etc.) to operations and finally implementation and optimization but it is imperative that people keep listening to each other. Especially the gap between the exploratory and the operational contribution will require energy to overcome but if they can manage that it should lay the basis for a successful speed-to-market dialogue. Looking at both dimensions combined, it is clear that this group will face challenges around focussing on, discussing and executing technical innovation challenges and, to a lesser extent, operational activities. Finally, when it comes to the Managing Complexity dimension, there are no true specialists in this team, which could create challenges around working with deep-rooted expertise on specific topics, having healthy, fact-based, stubborn opinions around important theories and hypotheses and in moving from the broad, abstract and strategic to the in-depth, concrete and execution-focused. Introducing one or more specialist views into the team will help with these areas and as a result deepen the strategic dialogue and improve the team’s ability to deal with unexpected and complex challenges.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit  
Description: For a group this small, it shows relatively good cognitive diversity within this dimension, with a strong focus on relationships. This pronounced inclination towards relationships ensures that the group carefully considers market, customer, and stakeholder needs, as well as usability, when making decisions. They ask crucial questions such as: Do our products/services meet people's needs? Will they be found useful? How can we improve usability? In addition, the other side of this dimension is also represented through a natural contribution in the area of content. As a result, the group consistently explores opportunities for system efficiency and technical robustness. They delve into technological feasibility and strive for continuous improvement. However, there is a missing natural connecting link between these two sides: the 'Bridge Builders,' individuals who can effortlessly navigate both perspectives. These individuals have the potential to foster mutual understanding and act as key players in translating ideas between the two ends of the spectrum. Ideally, they would reach out to each other when necessary, bringing that perspective more into the group.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: The group demonstrates a fairly balanced distribution along the Growth Curve, with a focus on the second phase of operations, leaning towards optimization. These more optimization-driven contributions ensure that the group naturally avoids overlooking critical questions necessary for preventing technical errors, establishing essential structures, and completing products or projects to the highest standards. Additionally, building and improving existing foundations (an inside-out perspective on change) will remain a priority. The simultaneous focus on exploration provides a complementary outside-in perspective, generating new ideas. They are dynamic, spot opportunities everywhere, and are eager to drive change. If the group manages to bridge the gap in the first phase of operations, this team is capable of naturally managing the relay race of change and innovation from start to finish.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This group demonstrates a strong cognitive mix in this dimension, with a clear tendency toward a generalist perspective. This indicates their ability to approach problems and situations from a broad, high-over, strategic and complex standpoint, considering various perspectives before making decisions. They tend to prioritize group objectives over individual departmental interests. This broad perspective allows them to oversee more of the Growth Curve and to facilitate productive dialogues across different areas. However, an excess of generalist thinking can lead to prolonged decision-making processes, as they may get caught up in complex analyses. To counterbalance this, the group benefits from individuals with a more specialist mindset, who excel in analyzing problems from a focused and in-depth perspective. Their valuable ability to untangle complex challenges and arrive at solutions is essential for efficient and effective decision-making. Diversity along this dimension is what enables a team to effectively deal with and manage complex challenges, as long as the communication between the different contributions is clear and transparent.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: When analyzing the combination of the Attachment and Exploration dimensions, we identify five distinct result areas. This group demonstrates a well-distributed spread across three quadrants: the optimisation-content quadrant, the exploration-relationship quadrant and the optimisation-relationship quadrant, creating a golden opportunity to foster dialogues that yield optimal results. The Optimization-Content quadrant contributes to consolidating long-term systems, paying attention to detail, and critically evaluating new ideas and inventions. The Exploration-Relationship quadrant is vital for engaging stakeholders and "selling" ideas to a variety of individuals. The Optimization-Relationship quadrant is crucial for sustaining changes and ensuring service excellence, long-term relationships, and group cohesion. However, the absence of contributions in the Exploration-Content quadrant may mean that the team naturally spends less time exploring and developing new technologies, theories, and systems, or responding to new content-related developments (e.g., Artificial Intelligence). The relevance of this gap in the group's cognitive diversity will depend on shared outcome areas and strategic goals. The central Operation Core is where all contributions converge. If utilized effectively, individuals can act as strategic connectors across the entire Growth Curve. However, the group does not show natural contributions in this zone, which in certain cases could lead to delays in taking action.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team shows a polarized distribution across the Business Performance Dialogue, with contributions concentrated in the first and third phases—“Changing with People” and “Structured Delivery”—and no natural contributions in the middle phase, the Operational Core. Team members on one side are skilled in stakeholder engagement, inspiring others, and mobilizing change. On the other, members focus on embedding change through systems, processes, and long-term structures. Together, these strengths support a “You ask, we deliver” mindset that can drive strong project execution. However, the lack of contributors in the middle phase creates a gap in operational alignment—the bridge that connects inspiration with execution. This absence can lead to fragmentation, reduced mutual understanding, and potential tension between visionary and delivery-driven profiles. Because these contributions sit in diagonal opposition, with no shared cognitive ground between them, the risk of misalignment is higher. Yet, when managed thoughtfully, such oppositional dynamics can also become a source of powerful collaboration—allowing contrasting styles to complement each other and strengthen overall performance.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This group shows some gaps in their distribution along the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue, which involves protecting and nurturing inventive ideas, practices, and initiatives within an organization. We do not observe clear natural contributions at the beginning of this dialogue, where changes are embraced from an inventive and research-oriented approach. These contributions are crucial for initiating the invention phase of the dialogue, especially in relation to product development. Further along in the dialogue, there are also no natural contributions in the operational aspect, where tendencies to test substantive inventions and develop prototypes typically emerge. Whether these aspects are relevant for this group depends on their strategic goals and target outcomes. At the end of this dialogue, we do see a natural contribution emerge, focused on the relationship-optimization perspective. This contribution is essential for "sustaining changes with people" and includes elements such as supporting individuals, delivering excellent service to clients and employees, managing long-term relationships, and ensuring group cohesion. While this is not always considered during discussions about change, it is vital for the successful implementation of new changes, transformations, or mergers within the organization.


Project: Hult
Focus: Summary
Description: On the Attachment dimension this team scores completely on the relationship-side over the content-side. This team will focus almost exclusively on people - whether they are clients, employees, partners or other stakeholders. Even though this team will undoubtedly understand and acknowledge the importance of product quality and efficient processes, stakeholder wellbeing and satisfaction will always take precedence over these. There are some very strong points to this focus: it will lead to very strong and long-lasting stakeholder relationships and very high scores on customer and employee satisfaction. However, no focus on the content-side might mean product quality or process efficiency can suffer. Depending on the nature of this team, these are always important factors to consider. One additional thing to keep in mind is since everyone is clustered on the same side of this dimension, people will definitely speak the same language and understand each other well but at the same time they might also lack diversity in thought and perception. When it comes to the Exploration dimension, this group consists of two clear clusters: two contributions on the exploratory side and four contributions on the optimization side. This does mean the group has the capability to both explore new ideas and opportunities as well as to implement and optimize these opportunities. There is some misbalance here, though: with the majority of contributions on the optimization side it is very possible that the exploratory voices are not heard or given the priority they need. Finally, one major challenge here is the execution gap that exists between these two groups along this dimension: there is a very real risk of polarization between these two groups, potentially exacerbated by tensions from operational failure. It will take these team members all their effort to understand each other and they will need to keep putting in energy to hear each other’s viewpoints. Finally, they will need to stretch themselves to the middle of this dimension in order to be able to successfully execute. Looking at the floor of the AEM-Cube, this group shows real strengths in the right and left back quadrants (e.g., commercial activities and customer service or account management). However, the content- and operational quadrants are completely empty, indicating big challenges when it comes to product- or process quality and execution power. Finally, when it comes to the Managing Complexity dimension, there is a very healthy diversity, indicating that the group is very capable of effectively managing complex challenges. The challenge here is that the generalist contributions are both on the exploratory side and the more moderate and specialist contributions are all more the optimizing side of the cube. However, if they are able to listen to each other this group will be able to facilitate a very deep and meaning strategic dialogue and will be able to move from strategy to execution very effectively.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: The Attachment dimension sheds light on how individuals naturally engage with their surroundings. In this group, there is a distinct inclination towards the Relationship-focused facet of the Attachment dimension. This shows the group's innate tendency to consider the thoughts, ideas, feelings, and perspectives of others, whether they are colleagues, clients, partners, or stakeholders. Collaborative work and team synergy invigorate them, even if their job content doesn't explicitly necessitate group involvement. Harnessing this strong relationship-oriented trait effectively can cultivate a team that consistently infuses client and market perspectives into new projects, ongoing initiatives, product development, and decision-making. They pose crucial questions: Are our products/services addressing people's needs? Will they derive value from them? How can we enhance user-friendliness? However, there is a lack of natural contributions toward the Content-focus side of the Attachment dimension, which involves individuals who perpetually explore avenues for creation, invention, and system efficiency. They delve into technological viability and strive for continual enhancements. Depending on the team's strategic goals and result areas, they might exhibit a lesser natural inclination to delve into the content-oriented aspect when problem-solving, creating products, or establishing new projects.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This group exhibits two distinct clusters along the Exploration dimension, with one-third inclined towards Exploration and two-thirds leaning towards Optimisation. This suggests a team in which one-third of the members are individuals naturally inclined towards an outside-in perspective on change—generating fresh ideas and strategizing around them. They embody a keen drive for change, contributing significantly to the initial stages of the Growth-Curve. On the other hand, there are those who naturally contribute towards solidifying these ideas and concluding tasks initiated earlier in the process. They possess an inherent ability to perceive from an inside-out perspective. Skillfully managed, this dynamic holds the potential to foster meaningful dialogues—from ideation to tangible outcomes. The absence of contributions in the middle, the Operational Core, poses the risk of delaying the transition to execution. It might keep the team entangled in debates about ideas vs outcomes, opportunities vs risks, hindering swift progress into action

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This group showcases a highly beneficial cognitive balance within the Managing Complexity dimension. The presence of Generalists within the team imparts a natural ability to tackle problems and situations from a multifaceted perspective. This approach involves carefully considering a range of viewpoints before arriving at well-rounded decisions. They tend to exhibit a commendable focus on prioritizing collective goals over individual departmental interests. This broad perspective not only allows them to effectively oversee various aspects of the Growth-Curve but also fosters the cultivation of constructive dialogues spanning diverse domains. However, it's essential to be aware that an undue emphasis on generalist thinking might inadvertently lead to prolonged decision-making processes. The intricate analyses that accompany this approach can sometimes unnecessarily slow things down. To counterbalance this, the group greatly benefits from the contributions of individuals with a Specialist attitude. These Specialists excel in dissecting complex problems with a laser-focused, in-depth perspective. Their invaluable ability to disentangle intricacies and devise pinpoint solutions becomes particularly significant in the realm of regular decision-making. A critical role within this dimension is represented by contributions situated in the middle. These individuals play an integral role as mediators in the strategic dialogue between the contrasting thought processes of complex and complicated problem management—Generalist versus Specialist. These Bridge Builders bridge the gap between two distinct ways of thinking. Their unique capacity to flexibly transition between Generalist and Specialist modes of thought makes them pivotal assets. For this specific group, leveraging their innate contributions during strategic decision-making positions them exceptionally well. By harnessing the strengths of both Generalists and Specialists, the team can adeptly address a myriad of complex challenges and issues that may arise in diverse scenarios. 

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: When combining the Attachment and Exploration dimensions, we can identify five distinct result areas. In this group, contributions are clustered in two specific quadrants: Relationship–Exploration and Relationship–Optimization. While this creates a valuable opportunity for dialogue and complementary collaboration, it also presents a challenge: the other two key quadrants—Content–Exploration and Content–Optimization—are currently unrepresented in this team. These missing contributions are critical. The Content–Exploration quadrant drives innovation, experimentation, and new ideas, while the Content–Optimization quadrant supports the integration, refinement, and structuring of those ideas within the organisation. Without contributions in these areas, the team may face blind spots in both inventing and embedding content-driven initiatives, especially if such outcomes are central to the team’s strategic goals. At the center of lies the Operational Core—the area that connects all quadrants. Team members who contribute here can act as strategic bridges, enabling smoother collaboration between content- and relationship-focused individuals along the Growth Curve. While this team may currently lack strong representation in that central space, there is potential for individuals to stretch into this role and support more integrated, cross-functional dialogue.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This group shows a clear concentration of contributions in the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue—“Changing with People.” Team members in this phase are naturally skilled at stakeholder engagement, influencing others, and creating energy around change. They excel at selling ideas within the organisation and rallying people to support new directions. These contributions are crucial for building momentum and initiating movement toward the next Growth Curve, supported by strong internal relationships. However, there are notable gaps in the second phase—Operational Execution—and the third phase—Structured Delivery. The team lacks natural contributions in these areas, which are essential for translating ideas into structured action and embedding change into systems, processes, and long-term routines. Without representation in these later phases, there is a risk that change efforts may lose traction after initial buy-in. The team may generate enthusiasm and alignment around new directions, but struggle to maintain progress or deliver sustainable outcomes. If this dialogue reflects the team’s strategic focus—such as leading change or driving transformation—it would be valuable to assess how well the team is currently equipped to move beyond initiating change. Understanding where follow-through may be lacking can reveal opportunities to strengthen the team's overall impact and effectiveness.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This group shows a clear concentration of contributions in the final phase of the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, which focuses on embedding innovation through long-term support, service delivery, relationship management, and team cohesion. These contributions are essential for ensuring that change and innovation are successfully adopted and sustained across the organisation. However, the group lacks natural contributions in the earlier phases—Inventive Exploration and Operational Testing. These stages are key for initiating innovation, generating new ideas, and turning them into practical solutions. Their absence suggests a limited capacity within the team to lead the early stages of innovation independently. Whether this gap is significant depends on the team’s strategic role. If their focus is on implementation and adoption, the current distribution may be appropriate. If, however, the team is expected to drive innovation from idea to execution, these missing contributions could pose a challenge.


Project: 1
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a team that excels in implementing, improving, streamlining and optimising existing ideas and processes. The dialogue in this team will be heavily focused on expanding what already exists rather than thinking of radically new opportunities and exploring disruptive new chances. It is a team that will move and operate in a deliberate manner with a keen eye for detail. It is great in executing ideas and initiatives and will do a great job structuring and stabilizing the business. The biggest challenge for this team will be renewal: delivering disruption and/or reinventing itself will not be a priority and it can be too reactive sudden changes in its larger environment. It is really nicely balanced and spread out along the Attachment dimension, indicating that it will be able to deliver a very deep and effective product-client dialogue. The more content-focused contributions will add value on the product and process side, naturally focusing on gathering and utilizing data to improve and optimize these where possible. The relationship-focused contributions will naturally keep an eye on the client’s needs and wishes and will do a great job listening to- and supporting them where necessary. This spread allows the team to align the product deliverables to the client’s demands. The one thing this team needs to look out for though is the gap between these two extremes: if the group is put under pressure this gap might cause misunderstandings and polarization between these two subgroups, which might hinder the overall team performance and effectiveness. Combined with the exploration dimension it is important to note that this entire product-client dialogue will mainly be geared to building out existing client relationships, existing processes and improving existing products rather than exploring new opportunities or coming up with radical new ideas. Finally, there is a near perfect spread and balance along the vertical dimension: this diversity allows the team to facilitate a very deep strategic dialogue which will enable it manage complex situations and challenges in a very effective manner. The generalists will help to reflect on these situations from multiple different angles and consider different viewpoints, the specialists will naturally focus on details overlooked by others and bring their deep expertise-driven focus to actively gather knowledge and experience and make sure the team doesn’t get stranded in dialogue and reflection and the more moderate, bridging contributions are crucial in making sure people understand each other and work together even when put under stress. Overall this is a team that will struggle with disruption and renewal but that is set-up to effectively execute, deliver results and monitor progress in a deliberate, thoughtful manner through all kinds of complex situations and challenges.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: This group is highly diverse along the Attachment dimension, indicating that it has the building blocks to both focus on content- and people-related topics and issues. However, the group is divided into two clusters, with the gap in the middle potentially hindering effective communication. If things are running smoothly, this group will be able to facilitate a very strong and effective product-client dialogue. It’s when the group is put under stress that this dialogue will be tested though, with the people in each of the two clusters potentially grouping more tightly together and not listening to the other cluster well enough. In this case, the people in the relationship-oriented cluster (being more service-driven and supportive) will want to prioritize the emotions, feelings and personal needs of others both within and outside of this group, whereas people on the content-oriented side will prefer to fall back on solid structures, arrangements and agreements to make sure things are running smoothly (being more monitoring and structuring).

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: Looking at the spread on the Exploration dimension, this group is a very operationally minded group with a slight focus on optimization and implementation. Given the lack of diversity on this dimension, it will be difficult to facilitate an effective speed-to-market dialogue. The lack of exploratory people will make it tough to continuously test the status quo and come up with radically new ways of doing things, while the lack of true optimizers can cause the group to perform suboptimally when it comes to optimizing and fine-tuning processes. Where it will excel at, however, is continuously delivering tangible results at high energy and with high quality. There is one individual contributing in a more exploratory manner and one in a more optimizing manner. These are very valuable contributions that are able to naturally increase the diversity and the effectiveness of the speed-to-market dialogue but overall they will not be able to make the greatest impact given the predominance of contributions in the middle of this dimension.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: There is very strong diversity along the Managing-Complexity dimension, laying the basis for a powerful Strategic Agility dialogue. With a near-perfect balance between specialists, generalists and bridge-builders, this group will be able to move between deep-rooted passion and expertise and a broader, more strategic perspective with ease. The benefits of a high diversity along this dimension are seen in people challenging each other more, being able to answer more questions and delivering a wider range of more unique contributions, all while being able to facilitate a healthy environment for discussions, both within the group and between this group and others. It will be able to focus on the specific, expertise- and experience-dependent challenges while also placing its challenges, priorities, activities and results in it’s (or it’s organization’s) broader strategic context. As long as people trust each other and are willing to really listen to each other (something that is even more important in high-diverse groups), this group will be exceptionally well-positioned to manage complex challenges and could therefore be an ideal leadership team.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: When looking at the floor of the AEM-Cube, that is to say, the combination of Attachment and Exploration, it is clear that the left-front (content-optimization) and left-back (people-optimization) quadrants are very well represented. This group will have a very deliberate, patient and sometimes reactive way of interacting, analyzing and coming to decisions where they will make sure that both the content of the situation and/or challenge is understand and addressed adequately whilst making sure that there is attention for the people’s needs and the way are impacted by these decisions. On the other hand, both the right-front (content-exploratory) and right-back (people-exploratory) quadrants are left almost completely open, indicating that renewing, changing and disrupting will be challenging and probably not a priority for this group, both introducing radical change for others, as well as dealing with sudden changes internally. A spread like this would be excellent for, say, and HR department or a legal firm that needs to have a clear eye for both the deep-rooted content challenges that it face and the people that it impacts and works with or for whilst mostly being relied on to deliver stable, predictable quality rather than to constantly reinvent the wheel. Finally, the middle quadrant (the “operational core” of the AEM-Cube) only includes two people, indicating that both “keeping things moving”, prioritizing operational excellence and bridging the content- and people sides of the strategic dialogue will be challenges for this team that need to be kept in mind.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: When looking at the Business Performance Dialogue, there are practically no contributions in the first phase and only one team member in the middle phase of this dialogue. Most of the team's attention will be centered to the last phase, which revolves around consolidating, monitoring and optimizing the results that came before it. This will result in a group that is focused on reliability, quality and stability but will have trouble proactively seeking change, finding new opportunities or launching new projects. It can be perceived as being too reactive in these areas and if it wants to strengthen this dialogue internally it would benefit from having a few more people contributing to the earlier phases. This will help the team to become more entrepreneurial, more inspiring and more outreaching to other people and will help to reach and engage others in starting new initiatives.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: The Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue highlights the importance of not only protecting ideas but also caring for people—within the team and across stakeholder relationships. This team shows a clear concentration in the third phase—Sustaining with People, indicating a strong natural focus on embedding innovations, maintaining alignment with stakeholder needs, and ensuring cohesion during change. These members are likely effective at supporting long-term implementation and organisational continuity. Two team members contribute near the Operational Testing phase, offering some ability to turn ideas into practical steps and bridge between exploration and delivery. However, the team lacks contributions in the first phase—Inventive Exploration, which limits its capacity to initiate new ideas or challenge existing practices. To maintain agility, the team may need to bring in more exploratory input—either through role development or collaboration with others. This profile suggests a team that excels at sustaining change, but may benefit from strengthening its front-end innovation capabilities.


Project: 2
Focus: Summary
Description: This team is clustered in the exploratory, content-focused corner of the AEM-Cube. As a result of this small cluster, people will understand each other and be able to work together well and will find communication and cooperation often comfortable and easy. However, the discussion might also be quite one-sided. This won’t be a problem if this team aligns well with its core result areas but if it doesn’t it might find that it could use more different viewpoints. Given its high exploratory focus, this team will focus all its attention on coming up with up with new solutions and ideas. The dialogue in this team focus heavily on creating new things: thinking out of the box and often coming up with radical new ideas and concepts. Due to its heavy exploratory focus, this team really excels in moving fast; coming up with something and testing it out. As a result, people on the outside will often be amazed with everything this team comes up with and can sometimes find it challenging to keep up. However, actually finishing things, having an eye for detail and really thinking through the consequences of its actions will not be areas of energy for this team. Given its strong content-focus, the dialogue and dynamics in this team will often be very rational, data-driven and facts-oriented. It will not necessarily be perceived as a warm and cosy environment but rather one where performance and results are prioritised. Task-based conflicts are often seen as healthy and as part of the process. As a result, when people disagree with each other things can often heat up but these will often be resolved quickly again when the other party is presented by data and facts strong enough to persuade them. Given this rational, fast-moving way of working, a team like this excels in areas like R&D, product development or technical sales. There is a healthy variability along the Managing Complexity dimension, allowing for a deep strategic dialogue where people are capable of challenging each other without losing sight of the overall process. However, there is some skewness to the generalist side of things, which could create the risk of people engaging in too much analysis, dialogue and wanting to see things from many different angles, slowing down the processes and potentially losing sight of the true in-depth specialised focus areas that are needed for the most expertise-driven tasks and challenges.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: This team is a highly technical or theoretical team with a very strong focus on content. All the members contribute to the content side of the Attachment dimension, creating a very rational and fact-driven environment. People will not shy away from task-based conflicts and often see disagreements as part of a healthy cooperation and necessary to make progress. Attention to people’s feelings and emotional needs might be pushed backwards and will often come more secondary, leading to an environment that can feel cold or impersonal to outsiders but that will be very comfortable to the people operating within. A serious point of attention for a team like this is the client’s needs and wants: in their unbridled enthusiasm to focus on the product’s capabilities, the necessary processes and/or the knowledge base of the team members they can sometimes forget to listen to what the client actually wants or how the client feels on an emotional level.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This is a highly exploratory team with little focus on operationalizing and optimizing their ideas and initiatives. This team will be very much focused on the future, continuously engaged by the potential of new ideas and always on the lookout for new opportunities, which can come across as unrealistic, impulsive or even reckless in the eyes of others. A continuous challenge for a team like this will be considering the results or outcomes of their actions and decisions, which can lead to a loss of productivity or efficiency: the focus of their dialogue will always first be on “what can be done” rather than “what should be done”. It would help the team in delivering performance to have more people contributing to the operational and optimizing areas of the Cube, this will definitely increase efficiency and decrease the number of mistakes made. The positive side of this diversity however is that the team will be highly energetic and fast-moving, unafraid to try new things and often coming up with radical, out-of-the-box ideas before others do.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: There is a relatively nice spread in the contributions in this team along the vertical dimension, which will help to create an environment where everyone can contribute and will increase the effectiveness of the internal dialogues. There is skewness towards the generalist side however, which will probably cause the team to have a broader, more generalist and more strategic focus rather than really go deep into the subject matter at hand. Due to this large amount of generalists there is a risk of this team losing time in continuously trying to look at situations from multiple angles and always wanting to involve everyone into the conversation. However, if the team is aware of this potential pitfall it can actively avoid this by listening to the more specialist voices in the team and to encourage them to keep challenging the process and keep following their intuition.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team falls entirely in the content-exploratory quadrant of the AEM-Cube: delivering technical and theoretical inventions in a quick tempo. They love exploring new ideas and opportunities and are supported in doing so by a highly rational and factual way of looking at things. They love to share and challenge ideas and get excited by new possibilities that they might discover together. However, the other quadrants are left completely empty, giving the notion that this might be a technical start-up team, an R&D team or a different type of technical innovation team. Given the fact there is nobody present in the people-exploratory quadrant will hinder the team’s potential to successfully turn their ideas into a profitable business: this, after all, is always done together with other people, whether they be clients or partners. The lack of people in the content-optimizing area will create the challenge of successfully turning ideas into actual profitable products or efficient processes, while the lack of people in the people-optimizing area will create challenges around customer service and paying attention to the emotional needs within the team. Finally, because the middle quadrant in the AEM-Cube (the “operational core”) is almost completely open, this team will be challenged to really move forward with all its ideas and turn them into real tangible results and products.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team currently lacks the foundation for an effective Business Performance Dialogue, which depends on smooth collaboration across three phases: Changing with People (exploratory, client- and sales-driven), the Operational Core, and Structured Delivery. Instead, the team is almost entirely concentrated outside of this dialogue, in the Content–Exploration corner, with a strong focus on ideas and expertise rather than stakeholder engagement or business execution. As a result, the team may struggle to manage the full journey from spotting new opportunities and understanding client needs to translating those into tangible business propositions. With no natural contributions in the later phases, it will also be difficult to consolidate and optimise ideas into sustainable outcomes. This imbalance poses a real challenge to the team’s ability to move effectively from insight to implementation—and ultimately to deliver on business performance goals.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: Regarding the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue, this team will absolutely excel in the initial phases of this dialogue. It will always deliver new ideas and come up with new concepts and products that might form the basis of a radical new approach or a valuable business. However, given the lack of contributions towards the two later phases, it will be difficult to build lasting client relationships and manage the political landscapes that one will encounter when trying to land a new proposition or convince a potential client or partner to work with you. This team will always see new opportunities and will always think outside the box, but convincing others of their standpoint and their opinion requires a patience and an empathy that will not usually be this team’s strength. Thus, even though they may be great at covering the early phases of this dialogue, it will be a challenge to actually pull through and deliver on all the promises without help from outside.


Project: 3
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a true operational team. All the contributions fall in the middle quadrant of the AEM-Cube; indicating an environment where people are most focused on delivering the best possible results in the here-and-now. Even though there are three different clusters distinguishable, they are so close to each other that this should not present much problems. The priorities are usually making sure that things keep moving at all times, that ideas are turned into visible, tangible results and that performance is maximized at all times. On the exploration dimension, this team scores very much in the middle between exploration and optimization. This enables the team to connect new ideas to existing ways of working and makes sure these ideas are implemented as efficiently and successfully as possible. This team is always connecting the future vision of the more exploratory people in the organization to the more optimizing people that value learning from the past and are very much at home monitoring, controlling and optimizing products and processes. As a result this team has a very can-do attitude; rolling up its sleeves and always focused on delivering output and results. When it comes to the Attachment dimension, this team is also clustered in the center between the two extremes. It is very much focused on bridging content and people; always keeping an eye on which content is relevant and how it should be interpreted and on the other always making sure the people involved are heard and their needs are met. It understands the needs of clients and other stakeholders and knows where to find the relevant content and at the same time it understands data and concepts and knows how to explain these to the relevant stakeholders. Combining the positions on the Exploration and the Attachment dimensions, a team like this is often perceived as being a very high-energy, results-oriented environment where there is room and attention for healthy interpersonal interactions and relationships. However, an environment like this can occasionally also become very ad-hoc, where day-to-day performance and results take precedence over long-term strategy. When it comes to the Managing Complexity dimension, this team skews quite heavily towards the middle, indicating a team that will be very comfortable working together and where people will understand each other quite well but where the strategic dialogue might lack in depth. This composition can lead to quite discussions that remain quite superficial and one-sided. It will allow people to stretch into either direction but this becomes difficult whenever the team is put under pressure. It could really benefit from one or more generalists to help oversee the processes and overall strategy and from one or more specialists to help sharpen the dialogue and bring in more focus or quality and execution. Adding more variety on this dimension will also enable the team to deal with complex challenges more effectively.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: This team is positioned almost perfectly in the middle of the Attachment dimension, indicating a team that excels at bridging both the people and content sides of the AEM-Cube. This means it is always aware of both the needs and capabilities within the team or organization on the content side (the internal processes, expertise, products, data, etc.) as well as the needs and capabilities within the team or organisation on the people side (think employees, culture, atmosphere, conflicts, etc.). It is keenly aware of both what the team or organization is capable of and what it can deliver as well as what is needed and how to bring these two together. It can translate client or employee needs into the required project statements or process requirements or explain specific technical or data-driven features of a product to customers or certain process decisions to employees.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team contributes to the middle phases of the Exploration dimension, indicating a highly operational focus: rolling up their sleeves, getting to work and keeping things moving. These are the phases where ideas are translated into tangible results. This is usually a highly energetic environment where people love to focus on delivering results and output in the here-and-now. It is not an environment where radical out-of-the-box ideas are constantly being generated but rather an environment with a focus on executing tried-and-true propositions to the highest standards. A team with this composition in the middle of the Exploration dimension is usually quite allergic to bureaucracy and to anything that slows down operations (filling in forms, having unnecessary meetings or meetings that go on too long, decision processes that go on too long, etc.). They are therefor helped by people or teams on the outside to pick up both these radical innovation questions as well as these more routine, optimizing result areas.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team has a reasonable spread along the Managing Complexity dimension. There is absolutely a healthy variety in contributions and no extreme cluster anywhere on this dimension, laying the foundation for a healthy dialogue that combines the expertise, drive and healthy stubbornness of the more specialist contributions in the team with the broader perspective, more reflective and dialogue driven nature of the more generalist contributions present. However, there are no extremes on either end (specialist or generalist) which will hinder the depth of this dialogue. This team could benefit from one or a few true specialist contributions and one or a few true generalist contributions. Even though the lack of this extreme diversity in this team might create an easier environment for people to communicate with each other (since they will use a more similar language and have more similar ideas), this tendency for all contributions to be more centered around the middle area creates for a potential shallower dialogue than we would ideally see when it comes to managing complex and unexpected situations and challenges. Something this team might look out for is if they are continuously experiencing fun, pleasant and easy-going meetings and discussions without much arguments or disagreements: this might feel very comfortable but this could indicate that some results are left on the table. After all, a little bit of friction and challenging is crucial for any discussion or dialogue to become as deep and powerful as it can be.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team is a true operational excellence team: it falls entirely within the middle area of the AEM-Cube (the “operational core”). It lacks any extreme focus on other areas: not many contributions in the content-exploratory quadrant means it will not be the ideal R&D team, no contributions in the people-exploratory quadrant means it will lack in the sales- and commercial result areas, few contributions in the people-optimizing quadrant will create challenges around customer service and no outspoken contributions in the people-content will result in little focus on and affinity for the monitoring and controlling result areas. However, as long as this team is supported externally in these areas and is given the space to really focus on the operational activities this team will excel and flourish, creating real tangible value out of what were initially only ideas.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: When it comes to the Business Performance dialogue, this team will focus on the middle phases and create meaningful value by connecting the people-exploratory contributions to the content-optimizing contributions. They can bridge the gap between them and make sure any operational activities are picked up. However, since these people-exploratory and content-optimising contributions are not present within the team itself it will have a hard time starting a successful enterprise all by itself. This team is an excellent engine without a car around it to drive forward. It will need one or a few contributions in the people-exploratory quadrant and require the other people in this team to stretch into the content-optimizing quadrant in order to fulfill the critical result areas other than operational excellence that are required for a successful dialogue along this dimension. This will be difficult and require a lot of energy and dedication and even though it can be done, it will not lead to optimal results: it might be better to bring in these contributions from outside the team and thus strengthen the entire team and enhance the total performance.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: Regarding the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue, this team excels in solving one of the biggest challenges along this dialogue: translating the messages from the content-exploratory people to the people-optimizing focused individuals and vice versa. In that capacity, it will play a critical supporting role in making sure this dialogue is fulfilled successfully. However, since neither of these types of people are really present within this team it will probably not be the most effective at executing on this dialogue and will have trouble navigating it from beginning to end. Even though it will be invaluable in this translating and bridging capacity and will turn the ideas generated by content-exploratory people into real, tangible results, since it does not have these people inside the team it will lack this hard innovation power itself. Additionally, it can support the people-optimizing people in this team by keeping things moving and delivering results at high pace, since these people are not present in the team itself it will have difficulty to keep focusing on maintaining warm, solid customer relationship and navigating the political landscapes of their clients, partners and other stakeholders, something which is absolutely critical if this dialogue is to be successful.


Project: 4
Focus: Summary
Description: This team excels in operations. All the contributions fall in the middle quadrant of the AEM-Cube, resulting in an environment where people are most focused on continually delivering tangible, measurable results. One thing that should be taken into consideration is the fact that there are two slightly more optimizing people with all the other being more exploratory. The difference is quite small so it won’t be a huge risk for conflict but it is important for the overall team performance to listen what they have to say so as to maximize the team’s efficiency and the quality of its results. The priorities are usually making sure that things keep moving at all times, that ideas are turned into visible, tangible results and that performance is maximized at all times. This team scores pretty much in the middle between exploration and optimization on the Exploration dimension. This allows the team to embrace new ideas while implementing them into existing ways of working. This team is always connecting future and past to make sure the present is operating as efficiently as possible. As a result this team has a very operational attitude; getting to work with a strong focus on delivering output and results. When it comes to the Attachment dimension, this team is also clustered right in the middle. It is very much focused on bridging content and people; always keeping an eye on the data and facts and how they should be interpreted and on the other always making sure the people involved are heard and feel comfortable and appreciated. It understands the needs of clients and other stakeholders and knows where to find the relevant content and at the same time it understands data and concepts and knows how to explain these to the stakeholders asking for them. Combining the positions on the Exploration and the Attachment dimensions, a team like this is often perceived as being a very high-energy, results-oriented environment where there is room and attention for healthy interpersonal interactions and relationships. However, an environment like this can occasionally also become very ad-hoc, where day-to-day performance and results take precedence over long-term strategy. When it comes to the Managing Complexity dimension, this team skews quite heavily towards the middle, indicating a team that will be very comfortable working together and where people will understand each other quite well but where the strategic dialogue might lack in depth. This composition can lead to quite discussions that remain quite superficial and one-sided. It will allow people to stretch into either direction but this becomes difficult whenever the team is put under pressure. It could really benefit from one or more generalists to help oversee the processes and overall strategy and from one or more specialists to help sharpen the dialogue and bring in more focus or quality and execution. Adding more variety on this dimension will also enable the team to deal with complex challenges more effectively.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: The whole team is concentrated around the middle of the Attachment axis; some members score slightly more towards the customer and/or market side, and some more towards the product side, but nobody in the team is extremely to one side. This could mean that the team has a balanced approach to both customer relationships and product focus. They are likely to be adept at understanding and addressing customer needs while also ensuring that the product development remains aligned with those needs. However, this balance might lead to a lack of strong focus in either area, thus it may struggle to push either the product or the customer relationships to the next level of excellence without more targeted efforts or leadership in one direction.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team is centered in the operational core of the exploration axis. This team naturally excels in execution, making it an ideal group for taking ideas sold by the sales team and ensuring they are delivered to the customer. They are essential in managing the operational side of the speed-to-market process, translating customer needs into tangible products and services that the company can sell or deliver. While speed is typically driven by more explorative behaviors, this team’s strength lies in operationalizing ideas from sales, marketing, and business development. They focus on fulfilling these ideas efficiently and ensuring that what was promised to the customer is delivered on time. Their role bridges the gap between concept and execution, ensuring that the company’s promises are met and customer expectations are satisfied.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team is a mix of specialists and generalists, with no clear dominance on either side. Their strength lies in translating the needs of both specialist and generalist colleagues into actionable tasks. However, the lack of strong expertise on either end can lead to overlooked perspectives, which can be addressed by inviting more specialized or generalist input when needed. A tendency toward groupthink may also hinder the team when managing complex problems, but this can be mitigated by assigning specific roles based on specialized or generalist viewpoints. The strategic dialogue in this team will often feel comfortable and relatively easy-going which is valuable but it is diversity along this dimension that adds depth to the discussions and increases the group's ability to effectively manage complex challenges.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: When examining the combination of the Attachment and Exploration dimensions, we identify five distinct result areas. This group primarily clusters in the operational quadrant, indicating a focus on the more operational side of the business, focusing on the here and now, rolling up the sleeves and making sure stuff gets done. However, this focus can lead them to be very hands-on and might miss the bigger picture of what needs to be done in the next 12 - 24 months for example. The group's fewer contributions in the optimising-content quadrant might result in lesser attention to details and making sure that stuff is nicely finalised. In the Explorative-relationship quadrant, essential for engaging with stakeholders, the group's lack of natural contribution might lead to losing connection with others. Focusing on the here and now is great, but needs to be shared with other stakeholders in a timely manner to keep the relationship and status update going. The Optimisation-relationship quadrant is underrepresented in this group but crucial for sustaining changes and ensuring service excellence, long-term relationships, and group cohesion. This contribution is vital for successful organisational transformations, with its relevance also dependent on specific goals. The Operational Core is where all contributions converge. If effectively leveraged, individuals here act as strategic connectors across the organisation and making sure that work is done. When looking at new colleagues to recruit, we would suggest that the team look at balancing their contributions. This can mean that they look for new team members with a more optimising attachment contribution or explorative attached to enhance the strategic diversity within this team. 

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This group shows a center occupied contribution along the Business Performance Dialogue. There are no natural contributions at the start of this dialogue, which focuses on ‘changing with people’, stakeholder management, connecting with customer or internal audiences, and inspiring people to embrace change. However, as we progress through the dialogue, we find a very strong natural contributions in the operational core, which focuses on translating these previously sold ideas into practical frameworks, projects, and applications. Further along, we encounter another gap where these practical operations should be turned into structured solutions and templates. The process concludes with few, yet effective contributions, ensuring that changes are solidified into business processes, systems, and long-term structures. Together, these positions foster a "You ask, we deliver" attitude that enhances the group's project performance. The group could benefit from examining how they interact with each other when dealing with a new project. How is in the lead of managing this project, what is the goal, who is in charge of stakeholder management and reflecting on customer satisfaction i.e. quality of the services delivered. The lack of the explorative - attachment side of the business will leave this team struggling to connect with others. Something the team can solve by cultivating strong relationships with other business units that have more explorative, customers focused contribution to play on this business performance dialogue. 

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is strongly concentrated in the Operational Testing phase of the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, indicating a natural strength in translating ideas into structured, workable solutions. They are well-equipped to assess feasibility and build the foundations needed to operationalise innovation. However, there are no natural contributions in the Inventive Exploration phase, which is essential for generating new ideas and challenging existing assumptions. Without input here, the team may struggle to initiate innovation. Supporting this gap may require creating a sandbox environment for experimentation and drawing on inventive contributions from elsewhere in the organisation. The Sustaining with People phase is also unrepresented. This limits the team’s ability to embed innovations long-term and ensure adoption by stakeholders. While a few members near the operational core might stretch into this space, the absence of relationship-optimising contributors could hinder lasting impact. To manage innovation effectively, the team should consider how to compensate for these gaps. Their operational strength is valuable, but without exploration and optimisation perspectives, they risk underdelivering on both ends of the innovation process.


Project: 5
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a team that is completely focused on optimization and people. It has a tight cluster of contributions in this corner, indicating a strong focus on dealing and interacting with people in a very patient, deliberate and observant manner. The culture of a team like this is usually very warm, cosy and friendly. The strong focus on optimization indicates a deliberate way of doing things in a very patient manner that prioritizes improving and optimizing processes over radically changing and improving things. They can get annoyed when people ignore existing processes and if things are done without being discussed. They can sometimes be perceived by other people or teams as being reactive or “dragging their feet” but they are not against change; it is just that their priority will usually be excellent execution and improving and stabilizing the processes necessary to deliver it. When it comes to the Attachment dimension, this team is strongly focused on the people-side of things. This indicates a team where a friendly atmosphere is key and where people will focus on personal attention for one another. They are very attuned to how people are feeling and to how they are doing on an emotional level. Combined with its strong optimising focus, this indicates a team with a keen eye for detail and sometimes a perfectionist attitude when it comes to looking after and taking care of people, whether they are their own team members or external stakeholders. However, this strong focus on maintaining a warm and friendly atmosphere can also lead to a culture of conflict avoidance: people can sometimes be uncomfortable to approach others in a critical way or interpret criticisms by others as personal attacks rather than task- or content-based criticisms. This conflict avoidance can hamper or undermine the team’s performance. If the team can manage this it could function excellently in a customer-service or patient-care environment, for instance. There is a very good spread on the vertical dimension, indicating this team is excellently equipped for a deep strategic dialogue that can both focus on the broader strategic challenges and processes as well as the deeper detail- and expertise oriented priorities of the team. This balance enables the team to deal very well with complex challenges when they arise, as long as every voice in the team is heard and taken into account.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This group displays a very strong preference for the relationship side of the attachment dimension. So, what can we expect from this group and their team dynamics when looking at the contribution towards the product-market fit dialogue? Well, their strength lies in their ability to think from a customer perspective i.e. what would the market like to see from our services. Having a strong reflective talent to think about the needs of a customer i.e. are the features that we provide something that our customers want?  However, something to reflect on for this group, is the lack of content. Meaning that their naturally tendency is to reflect more on the customer and/or market side than the qualities of the product. 

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This group has a very strong representation in the optimisation side of the AEM-Cube. In the context of the speed-to-market dialogue we see that there is a lack of representation of the exploration side of the business. Meaning that this group is well suited to work with people and teams that have a more explorative contribution and adding value to the conversation by poking holes in their way of working by reflecting on the pace of delivery and making sure that expectations are met. It would be good for this team to bounce off their ideas with other departments that have a more exploration focus. Together with these teams there are ingredients that will help a productive dialogue to ensure speed-to-market is achieved. 

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team consists of two people with a more specialist contribution, indicating a natural in-depth focus on the areas of their expertise, a couple of team members in the middle of this dimension, indicating a bridging contribution between specialists and generalists and a number of generalist contributors, who will instinctively prefer to oversee the entire system and/or process, connecting and enabling different people and bringing together ideas. The power of this diversity is that it deepens the strategic dialogue and enhances the group's ability to manage complex issues. However, this can only be achieved when communications and team dialogue is facilitated properly. E.g., it is important that there is no passive aggressive dictator or leader dominating the conversation and that people trust each other and actively and honestly listen to each other. If this is established, however, this team has the basis for a very deep and powerful strategic dialogue.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: Analyzing the interplay of the Attachment and Exploration dimensions reveals five distinct result areas. This team is fully concentrated in the Relationship-Optimization quadrant, excelling in sustaining change, ensuring service excellence, fostering long-term relationships, and promoting group cohesion. However, the absence of members in the remaining four areas creates significant blind spots. The lack of representation in the Explorative-Relationship quadrant may hinder the team’s ability to engage effectively with stakeholders, risking weakened connections. Similarly, the absence of contributions in both the Content-Optimization and Content-Exploration quadrants limits the team’s capacity for content-driven innovation and the seamless integration of new ideas into the organization. Depending on the team’s strategic goals, these gaps could present challenges to comprehensive collaboration. The Operational Core, where Relationship and Content contributions converge, represents a pivotal area for connecting efforts across the Growth Curve. While there is room for growth in this domain, the team shows potential to stretch into this role, becoming effective strategic connectors and enhancing their overall impact.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: When evaluating this team through the lens of the Business Performance Dialogue, a clear mismatch emerges between their natural contributions and what is required to navigate this dialogue effectively. The dialogue progresses from People-Exploration (driving change through collaboration and inspiration), through the Operational Core (structuring and executing), to Content-Optimisation (ensuring consistency, precision, and long-term delivery). However, this team has no natural contributors in any of these phases. Instead, their contributions are clustered entirely in the Relationship–Optimisation quadrant—outside the primary path of the dialogue. This lack of alignment poses a serious concern for the team’s ability to lead or manage business performance initiatives effectively. Simply put, they are likely out of their depth when it comes to translating new opportunities into actionable, scalable business results. To address this, the team should consider involving colleagues who are better suited to each phase of the dialogue. This could involve bringing in new members, or collaborating closely with other teams that have the necessary exploratory, operational, or content-driven perspectives. In its current composition, we would strongly advise against assigning this group sole responsibility for managing business performance. Without additional support, there is a high risk of misalignment and missed opportunities.
 
Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is heavily concentrated in the third phase of the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue—Sustaining with People—and lacks contributions in both earlier phases. There are no natural contributors in the first phase—Inventive Exploration, which is essential for initiating innovation, nor in the second phase—Operational Testing, where ideas are tested and translated into practical implementation. While the team is well-equipped to embed and maintain changes, it lacks the capability to generate or develop new ideas independently. As a result, this group is not positioned to manage the full innovation process on its own. To succeed, it will need to collaborate with others who bring exploratory and operational strengths. Without that, the risk of stalled or superficial innovation is high.


Project: 6
Focus: Summary
Description: This profile indicates a highly optimizing team that covers both the content- and people oriented sides of the Attachment dimension. However, the strong specialist focus and the big gap in the middle of the Attachment dimension pose significant challenges for the dynamics of this team. The very strong focus on optimization enables the team to move patiently, deliberately and detail-oriented than most other teams. It will be very much occupied with monitoring, controlling and optimising products and processes and the dialogue will focus heavily on observing, reflecting and learning. This team will bring tremendous stability and predictability to an organization and will often be admired for its structured and reliable way of working and communicating. However, even though it is in no way against it, it can find change and renewal difficult and stressful. People will look for routine and tradition for comfort and safety and they will encourage others to contribute in a similar way. This doesn’t have to be a problem but when radical change is needed to survive this can pose a significant challenge. The biggest hurdle for this team to manage and overcome when it comes to its dynamics lies in the Attachment dimension. Here there is a big cluster of contributions on the content-side with two people contributing all the way over to the people-side. This does enable the team to look at both sides of the product-client side and connect them but when the team is put under pressure or stress there is a risk of communication breakdowns along this dimension. People on the content-side have a different way of looking at and engaging in interactions than people on the people-side and these differences can cause significant misunderstandings and frustrations. However, when this gap is bridged and the two people-oriented contributions are heard and embraced by the team this can create a very powerful and successful product-client dialogue. Finally, when it comes to the Managing Complexity dimension, this team is filled with specialists. This creates a lot of focus on execution, details and expertise but also runs the risk of a very superficial strategic dialogue and emphasizes the risk of communication breakdowns when the team is put under stress. This team will work really well and with very high energy until things start to go wrong. The specialist positions can then result in people instinctively talking and contributing from their own viewpoints rather than reaching out to others, which can result in misunderstandings, frustrations and people not hearing each other. This team would benefit greatly from having two or more generalist contributions, preferably on each end of the Attachment dimension. This will help bridge the two clusters, better enable the team to deal with complex challenges and help the team to oversee and grasp the interpersonal processes.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: This team’s contributions run from content towards people side of the Cube. Regarding services and products that fit the market. There are two team contributors that can focus their contribution more towards the people side i.e. market side and translate what the company is making towards what the customers needs are. A great balance to have, albeit that the team has a slight preference towards the content side of things. One notable aspect of the members' distribution along the Attachment axis is that even though there are members on both ends, there is nobody in the middle, no bridge-builder, that could bring these two perspectives together. 

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: Based on the individual data points we can see a team that is more ‘grouped’ together around the optimisation side of the AEM-Cube. In relation to the speed-to-market dialogue you might see this team struggling with the exploration side of things. Somebody who leads the troops moving forward and taking the next steps to the horizon and understanding what possible steps might be taken. However, where this team excels is specifically that of optimising things. Making sure that what the organisation is selling is taken care off. 'We deliver what we promise' attitude, focusing on the here and now, what can we achieve with the things we already have. A fantastic team to have conversations around playing the ‘devil’s advocate’ and making sure that whatever the team is putting out there is hitting all the required check marks needed to deliver the right quality. This team’s strength is really to look at the possibilities from an analysis standpoint. Meaning that it will take the next step when all questions are answered in a proper manner. On the other hand, this team will struggle to keep up with the pace of more explorative teams. They will need a ‘golden bridge’ builder, i.e. someone who bridges the gap between exploration vs optimisation, in this case people in the middle of the AEM-Cube to translate the exploration power to a more practical side of things, with as a next step translating these insights towards the optimisation side of things. 

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This group exhibits a strong inclination toward a specialist perspective. This focus gives the team a powerful ability to think deeply from their individual viewpoints, though it may come at the cost of considering broader impacts on others. In contrast, a more generalist approach would foster integrative thinking, asking questions like, How can we translate these insights back into the organization? This group's superpower lies in driving detailed conversations, ensuring every "i" is dotted and every "t" crossed. However, this strength carries a potential downside: overlooking the broader context and impact of projects. Key risks include silo formation, where individuals become too focused on their own work without connecting to others, and a tendency for overly detailed discussions that can prolong decision-making, miss deadlines, and foster oppositional behavior. With the right training, facilitation, and reflective support, these challenges can be managed, allowing the team members to stretch themselves and harness their strengths effectively while mitigating potential pitfalls.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team is heavily concentrated in the Content–Optimisation quadrant, with a few members in Relationship–Optimisation, but none in the explorative quadrants. As a result, the team lacks natural contributions from those who typically generate new ideas, challenge the status quo, or bring in fresh, outside-in perspectives. While the current focus on structure and content ensures reliability and process strength, the absence of explorative voices may hinder innovation and adaptability. To expand the team’s strategic range, adding members in the top-right quadrant (Relationship–Exploration) could enhance customer focus and opportunity sensing, while someone in the top-left quadrant (Content–Exploration) could introduce more inventive, technically driven thinking. Since five members lean toward content, balancing this with broader perspectives could enrich team dialogue and performance. Using the AEM-Cube proactively—both to guide hiring decisions and to help new members integrate—can ensure new contributions are both impactful and sustainable.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: The Business Performance Dialogue is vital for aligning day-to-day management with strategic goals—covering areas like margins, customer satisfaction, and product quality. This dialogue typically flows from Relationship–Exploration (external, people-driven focus) through the Operational Core, and into Content–Optimisation (internal, structured execution). This team, however, lacks representation in the first two phases. There are no team members in Changing with People or the Operational Core, which means they may struggle to initiate customer-focused conversations or translate ideas into concrete operational plans. Instead, the team is strongly concentrated in the Structured Delivery phase, with a natural strength in executing processes, refining systems, and focusing on quality and results. While this executional strength is valuable, the main challenge lies in developing a stronger external and relational focus. Without it, the team risks becoming overly reactive and inward-looking, missing out on proactive stakeholder engagement and broader business development opportunities. To manage this dialogue effectively, they’ll need to stretch beyond their natural preferences or involve complementary perspectives from outside the team.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: Effective safeguarding of innovation requires balanced contributions across the three phases of the dialogue: Inventive Exploration (low attachment, high exploration), Operational Testing (mid-range on both dimensions), and Sustaining with People (high attachment, low exploration). This team, however, is largely positioned outside of the dialogue, with no members contributing naturally to the first two phases. Only two individuals are aligned with the final phase—Sustaining with People—which focuses on embedding innovations, supporting long-term relationships, and ensuring adoption across the organisation. While this anchoring in the final phase ensures that ideas—once implemented—can be embedded and accepted, the team lacks the early-stage energy needed to initiate and test new ideas. Without contributors who naturally explore, experiment, or operationalise innovation, the dialogue risks stalling before it begins. To strengthen their ability to manage innovation end-to-end, the team should consider bringing in perspectives from the Inventive Exploration and Operational Testing phases. This could involve internal role stretching or adding members who naturally contribute to these earlier phases. Without such reinforcements, the team may remain strong in maintaining what already exists—but challenged when it comes to generating and trialing new initiatives.

Project: 8
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a highly optimising team that is very much focused on content with a predominantly specialised focus and two generalist contributions to oversee the strategy and the team dynamics. The strong optimising focus indicates that this team focuses heavily on improving and optimising products and processes. It is not against change and disruption but it might come across as such; its top priorities will always be to monitor, control, stabilise and optimize. As such, it will be of great value in creating reliability and stability for the organization but it can at times unwittingly slow down transformations by asking too many difficult questions or thinking through the consequences too much. Discussions will focus mostly on how things have always gone, the traditions in the organization and what people can learn from the past rather than radical opportunities in the future. Looking at the Attachment dimension, this team is very heavily focused on content, resulting in an environment that is very data-driven and focused on facts and numbers. People in this team will be excited talking about anything to do with their field of interest or expertise, be it numbers, theories, processes, products, protocols, etcetera. In an environment like this, people’s feelings and emotions will usually not be at the forefront of the team’s priorities. As a result, this team can come across to others as being extremely rational with little to no consideration about clients and other stakeholders, yet being extremely passionate, diligent and results-oriented in the field of its expertise. Combining the contributions along the Exploration and Attachment dimensions, this is probably a very rational field where a keen eye for detail is required such as finance, legal or IT maintenance. Looking at the managing complexity dimension, this is a team with a lot of specialists, indicating an extreme amount of in-depth knowledge and skills that operates at the highest level of its field. The two generalist contributions are critical in overseeing the team dynamics and making sure all the specialists are able to deliver their very best contribution and in connecting the team’s results with that of other teams. It is in the combination of these specialists and generalists where the team’s capability lies in successfully dealing with complex challenges but the gap between them can pose serious challenges when it comes to understanding and communicating with each other. As long as they are able to bridge this gap and make sure that each voice is heard and accepted by the other team members they can deliver very strong results together.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This is a heavily content-focused team. The culture here will be rational and fact-driven, where people value deep content-based discussions based on good, reliable data. They will not shy away from task-based conflicts; they will often see these as part of a good cooperation. The people in this team love to challenge each other on their knowledge, expertise and opinions just as much as they love being challenged in this manner. For people from the outside looking in, this team might come across as cold and impersonal but for the people within this is exactly the environment where they thrive: an environment that stimulates them intellectually, one that is not too “soft” or emotional and one that celebrates good ideas, theories and data. Decision making in this team is not based on emotions or feelings and only rarely on personal preferences; rather, here the quality of the content people deliver is what matters.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This is a highly optimizing team: it is a team that prefers to move in deliberate, patient and careful manner. It contributes to the later stages of the growth process and does so with a keen eye for detail. Tough and important decisions are never made without a thorough investigation into the facts; people from outside this team might grow impatient or may perceive it as being too passive or too reactive. However, this deliberate and sometimes slow pace is not due to the team being passive but rather because it prioritizes stability, structure and reliable quality over everything else. It is not against change but it will not actively seek it out. Rather, it will naturally focus on maintaining and perfecting existing processes; monitoring progress, making sure everything is documented properly and controlling for any uncertainties that might arise. This team will always prioritize reliability and predictability and the team will work tirelessly to maintain this for itself and deliver this for others.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: The large majority of specialists in this group will create an atmosphere of maintaining excellence in results, where people will keep trying to one-up each other and will always want to be the best. This ensures that the results that are delivered will always be of the highest standard, but it can also create challenges when it comes to working together or when trying to manage complex challenges. A group of specialists like this will work together excellently right up to the point when they don’t: when this team is put under pressure, the bonds and communication between these specialists will be put under pressure. Often, they will instinctively focus more and more on delivering a perfect contribution themselves, rather than approaching others and working together. This is where the two generalist contributions in this team play a critical role: they will naturally be looking at bringing people together and integrating their ideas, visions, opinions, etcetera into the larger whole. They will be vital in making sure an atmosphere is created where the specialists excel and keep working together when things get tough and also in connecting this team to other teams or to its clients and partners. This is something that the specialists can absolutely do, but they will not often find themselves drawn to all the intricacies of the complex challenges in navigating all the strategic and political questions that arise in these situations.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team is fully dedicated to the content-optimization quadrant in the AEM-Cube. As such, it will naturally focus heavily on monitoring and controlling products, services and processes within the team or organization or with clients and partners. It has deep-rooted content-knowledge and will utilize this in a very deliberate, well thought-out manner. Work areas that it is really comfortable with are finance, legal, audit, risk, IT maintenance, etcetera. However, given that there are no contributions present outside of this quadrant, it will be very difficult to take on other activities in the long run. The lack of people in content-exploration quadrant will hinder its ability to radically think outside the box and come up with disruptive new ideas. No people in the people-exploratory quadrant means it will not be very commercial or launch new business ideas with other people. No people in the people-optimizing quadrant will hinder its ability to build long-term client relationships and to build a warm atmosphere with attention for people within the team (not the first priority of this group but something that will be more important if other contributions join). Finally, not many people in the operational core means that this is not a team that will excel at delivering tangible results in the here-and-now at high pace, keeping things moving and connecting other people and ideas.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is naturally aligned with the third phase of the Business Performance Dialogue: Structured Delivery. Their strengths lie in consolidating processes, optimising outcomes, and ensuring reliable, consistent execution. They bring a stabilising force to the organisation, focusing on structure, quality, and long-term sustainability. However, the team lacks natural contributors in the earlier phases. There is no representation in the first phase—Leading Change with People, which focuses on engaging stakeholders, initiating change, and bringing energy to new ideas and directions. Similarly, the second phase—Operational Core, which is essential for translating intentions into action, is also underrepresented. This imbalance presents a challenge: while the team can deliver effectively on established initiatives, it may struggle to generate momentum, engage others around new ideas, or convert vision into executable plans. To function successfully across the full dialogue, the team would benefit from complementary contributions—either by collaborating with others who naturally operate in these earlier phases or by intentionally developing capabilities within the team. This would allow them to better support the full performance cycle, from initiating change to embedding it sustainably.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is not naturally equipped to navigate the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, which spans three critical phases: Inventive Exploration (content-exploration), Operational Testing (central coordination), and Sustaining with People (people-optimising). The team lacks representation across all three phases, with no members contributing meaningfully to initiating innovation, testing ideas operationally, or embedding them through stakeholder alignment and long-term engagement. Given this absence, it may not be strategic for this team to prioritise managing this dialogue. If the team were to take on this responsibility, it would require significant stretching—both toward a more exploratory mindset and a stronger people orientation. While this is theoretically possible, it would demand substantial energy and effort, likely resulting in limited effectiveness. Instead, a more viable path would be to involve individuals from outside the team who naturally contribute to these underrepresented areas or to delegate ownership of these result areas to other teams that are better positioned to lead innovation safely and sustainably.

Project: 12
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a predominantly content-focused, optimizing team. On the Attachment dimension, 6 out of 9 contributions score towards the content-side of the AEM-Cube, indicating a team that will be mostly focused on data, facts, theories, ideas, concepts, processes and/or products. This is a team that is great at developing and researching technical concepts and products. Gathering data, analyzing them, forming conclusions and building products in a rigorous and structured manner will be a core focus and strength of this team. This is also a team that will be very much at home with monitoring and controlling processes within the business, making sure that protocols are followed and targets are achieved. There are a few contributions towards the middle of the Attachment dimension, indicating that this team will be able to work together with more relationship-oriented teams but usually will not be the most client-oriented team itself. By default, a team like this will usually be thinking more inside-out and be most at home and valuable for the organization when allowed to think about and focus on the product and processes whilst being supported by other, more relationship-focused teams. On the Exploration dimension, the majority of contributions is towards the optimization side, indicating a team that prefers to operate in a patient, deliberate, cautious and detail-oriented manner. This will be great for implementing ideas, optimizing processes and fine-tuning products. It usually operates in a very structured, stable and reliable manner but it can also be perceived as being slow and reactive at times. There are three more exploratory contributions that can be very helpful in generating new ideas, thinking outside the box and generally increasing the speed of execution within the team. There is a small gap on the Exploration dimension between these two subgroups but bridging this shouldn’t be too big a problem (especially given the amount of generalists in the team). The nine members of this team should be able to move quite efficiently from generating new ideas and to operationalizing, implementing and optimizing these ideas. Together with the Attachment dimension, this spread results in a predominantly optimizing and structuring team that will focus mostly on the existing products and processes and making sure these are as good as they can be and that they are understood and followed by all. Finally, when looking at the Managing Complexity dimension, there is a very wide diversity along this dimension, indicating a very strong capability in managing complex situations and -challenges and having a deep and impactful strategic dialogue. This is a group that can both focus on tactics, details and execution and lean back to engage in a more overarching strategic process-oriented overview. It can both assess how each individual can contribute optimally to the overall strategy of the team or the organization as well as enable them to do just that.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team's contributions lean heavily toward the content side of the AEM-Cube. With four members focused on content and the remaining five more centrally positioned—some leaning toward relationships but none fully on that end—there is a potential gap in people-focused contributions. A key question is whether those scoring higher on the attachment axis can stretch to bring stronger relationship-oriented insights into discussions. With the right meeting structure and facilitation, we believe this team can bridge the gap and effectively integrate these perspectives for a balanced product-market dialogue. 

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: When looking at the speed-to-market dialogue, we are looking at the ability to manage a dialogue from exploration towards optimisation. This is well equipped to manage this dialogue based on the team member that score more towards the exploration side of the cube, with a couple of team members contributing more in the middle, and also some contributors to the optimisation side of the cube. This dialogue usually pops up when teams are collaborating on new products, services and projects that are set up or sold to customers or internal stakeholders. When a project starts, usually driven by explorative contributions the next phase of delivery kicks in making sure that what people ‘promise’ or sell to stakeholders actually gets delivered on time. The last phase of this contribution is always the side of quality control. Making sure that the what we said we were going to do is actually delivered by the team. This dialogue is well preserved by the contribution of the different team members in this team. 

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This group showcases an strong blend of cognitive diversity. It includes contributors leaning toward the generalist perspective, scoring above the 60th percentile, two members in the middle and specialists scoring below the 30th percentile. This mix creates a dynamic balance of strengths. Generalist contributors (four in total) excel at reflecting on the broader scale, the larger context and the long-term impact of its work on the organization. Meanwhile, the middle-range contributors act as bridge builders, skillfully managing the dialogue between generalists and specialists. Specialists bring essential depth, but when they’re left alone with generalists, friction can arise—specialists may feel the conversation lacks focus and decisive action, while generalists may struggle when too much attention is paid on the minute details, losing sight of the bigger picture. The potential to harness this team’s cognitive diversity is big: they are well-positioned to handle complex challenges if communication is facilitated effectively. It is critical to structure conversations to connect specialist insights with generalist viewpoints—and vice versa. Research shows that teams with this composition outperform others in tackling complexity, provided they operate in a psychologically safe environment where everyone feels secure contributing their perspective.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team shows a reasonably balanced spread across the four quadrants of the AEM-Cube, with the strongest presence in the Content–Optimisation quadrant. Two members contribute from both the People–Optimisation and Content–Exploration quadrants, providing structure, relationship focus, and innovation from a technical angle. Only one member contributes to the People–Exploration quadrant, which supports external orientation, adaptability, and stakeholder-driven thinking. This composition suggests the team is well-equipped to deliver, optimise, and improve from within, but may lack natural energy for market exploration and stakeholder engagement. If the team considers a new hire, the clearest structural gap is in the People–Exploration quadrant. Adding someone with a strong relational and exploratory profile—ideally with a specialist perspective—would balance the team’s dialogue and complement its current strengths. However, the ideal fit ultimately depends on the team’s strategic priorities.
 
Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team demonstrates a fairly balanced distribution across the three phases of the Business Performance Dialogue. In Phase 1 – Changing with People, one team member brings exploratory and relational energy to the table, helping the team initiate ideas, engage others, and build early momentum. The dialogue then moves into Phase 2 – Operational Core, where two team members contribute the operational structure and process discipline required to translate ideas into concrete, reliable outcomes. Finally, in Phase 3 – Structured Delivery, one team member ensures a focus on quality, systems, and long-term value by offering a more analytical and content-driven perspective. With representation in all three phases, the team is equipped to take ideas from initiation through execution and delivery. To maximise this potential, the team may benefit from further reinforcing the connections between phases to create a more seamless and strategic performance dialogue.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: In the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, this team shows a well-rounded composition across the dialogue’s three phases. In Phase 1 – Inventive Exploration, team members on the content-exploration side contribute naturally to generating new ideas, challenging existing assumptions, and initiating innovation. The dialogue then moves into Phase 2 – Operational Testing, where no members are directly positioned, but a few are situated nearby and can contribute with a moderate degree of stretch. These individuals can help test feasibility, refine initial concepts, and begin operational alignment. In Phase 3 – Sustaining with People, again, while there are no team members squarely in this zone, a few members positioned near the attachment-optimization quadrant are well-placed to support the embedding of innovations, considering long-term stakeholder needs and organisational fit. Together, this spread suggests that while the core of the dialogue is strongest in the ideation phase, the team has access to perspectives across the full innovation lifecycle. With conscious effort to activate those near the edges of Phase 2 and 3, the team is well-positioned to manage this dialogue with continuity—from initial ideas to practical implementation and sustainable adoption.


Project: Canon Q&S
Focus: Summary
Description: This team shows strategic diversity along the growth curve, which indicates that this team is very well set up to move from idea ideation to operationalization to implementation and optimization. The strategic dialogue here will be balanced with equal priorities and attention to each of these phases as long as people are capable and encouraged to contribute to their natural strengths. The balancing dynamics in the early phases are focused on active interaction and opportunities with external relationships. There is no dominant content or technical input at that phase from within this team, which could mean that the typical exploration and start of innovation from the exploratory team members will be in people-focused innovations with a commercial and social focus and less on technology. If the latter is essential, it needs to be considered to come from outside this team.The balancing dynamics at the structuring and profit-generating phase of the late phases of the growth curve are mostly focused on the content sides of the business, such as the financial results, processes, protocols, relevant data, etc. The overall balance between relationships and content will be a strength to address the challenge to focus on both the people side of the business (both the client’s feelings, emotions, wishes, etc., as well as the dynamics and sentiments within the company) as well as the essential structured aspects like rules, procedures, laws, reports, checks and balances, data management. The spread along the vertical dimension indicates that this team is capable of engaging in a strategic dialogue about the bigger and, mid- and long-term picture and is capable of tackling complex challenges but will keep an energetic and practical connection with details and practicalities. 

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team leans slightly more toward the market side than the content side, although there is no strong tendency to prefer one over the other. Overall, there is somewhat more emphasis on the relationship side, but the dominant dynamic is the ability to connect both axes. The large cluster in the middle may lead to a somewhat one-sided dialogue where members are able to highlight both perspectives, supported by the more extreme contributions from either end of the axes.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team is well-suited for developing innovative ideas, like a product or service. With 2-3 members in the early stages of the Growth Curve, a strong operational core, and several in the optimization phase, the team is well-distributed along the exploration axis, allowing for smooth progression from exploration to optimization.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: Due to the strong skewness towards generalization, this team is very capable of understanding its context, thinking strategically, maintaining an overview and aligning short-term goals with long-term objectives across all phases of growth and development of challenges. The middle contributions on the Managing Complexity dimension can help translate the high-over, strategic, abstract thinking into practical, in-depth execution oriented messages where needed. They will also be able to stretch themselves into more specialised roles within the team but this will require energy and focus to do. There are no pure specialists, so this team will usually tend to adopt a somewhat broad approach and their discussions will sometimes be very general and strategic in nature, even though they might at times lack the depth that teams with more diversity on this dimension have. This team will benefit from a few true specialised contributions to help focus more on execution and bring in specific expertise in order to challenge and deepen the strategic dialogue.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: The two quadrants that dominate the team are the Relationship-Explorative quadrant and the Content-Optimization quadrant. This is a very typical setup for effective teams. Relationships are developed and leveraged to achieve success, supported by a solid counterbalance of consolidation, predictability, and control. One quadrant that is empty is the Content-Explorative quadrant, which indicates that technical innovation of any kind is likely not something this team can handle independently. The service-oriented aspect of this team is not overly prominent but is more than sufficient.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is well-equipped to support the full Business Performance Dialogue, with natural contributions present in all three phases. In Phase 1 – Changing with People, the team brings the exploratory and relational energy needed to generate ideas, engage stakeholders, and initiate new commercial or organisational initiatives. In Phase 2 – Operational Core, members contribute structure, coordination, and practical execution to translate ideas into action. Finally, in Phase 3 – Structured Delivery, the team offers focus on reliability, process discipline, and long-term consolidation—ensuring that outcomes are predictable, high-quality, and sustainable. This balance across phases enables a strong, end-to-end dialogue on business performance.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: In the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, this team shows a clear imbalance in contributions across the three phases. There are no members contributing to Phase 1 – Inventive Exploration, where new ideas and innovations typically originate from a content-driven, exploratory mindset. This absence makes it unlikely that substantive or technical innovation will emerge naturally from within the team. In Phase 2 – Operational Testing, the team is more strongly represented, with several members contributing to the implementation and practical validation of ideas. However, without a strong inflow of new concepts, this phase may lack momentum or novelty. Phase 3 – Sustaining with People sees just one contributor, offering some capacity to embed changes and maintain alignment with stakeholder needs, but limited depth in this area. Overall, while the team has some ability to test and execute, it lacks the necessary foundation and follow-through to manage the full safeguarding innovation cycle effectively.


Project: Canon Device Development Center 1
Focus: Summary 
Description:This team shows strategic diversity along the relationship-content axis only in the second half of the growth curve. This indicates that this team is set up to be reliable operationally, structured, and focused on repetitive rules, procedures, quality, and compliance. This team is capable of taking care of both the dynamics and sentiments of the employees and the service aspects of client care. This team's relationship focus is supporting the structuring and profit-generating focus on the content sides of the operations, like the financial results, the processes, the protocols, relevant data, etc. Without such a relationship-content balance, a culture could easily become too cold, boring, and bureaucratic, which is now probably prevented in this team, which has the opportunity of making its climate quite nice and staying energetic.This team shows a single team member in the exploratory part and, to a large extent, also in the vertical axis, quite at a distance from the other team members. There will be no doubt that this team member will have a very different, more exploratory, and strategic role or that this team member will not fit at all. Unless this is a strategic choice, the team has a challenge to integrate this more exploratory member. As a team, the competency is to be a good team in operations, production, or any mission that is focused on the optimization of the organizational structure. The vertical axis is, on average, low, which relates to a focus on individual competencies and can be a strong positive in this context. Within the operational team, there are two members who are high to very high on this axis and, as such, more integrated. These team members could fulfill a golden dialogue between the more content and relational aspects of the team. The average of this team on the vertical axis is below the 50th percentile, which means a strong focus and energy on individual competencies.The short of this team is that if it fits an operationally challenging task with zero failure tolerance, like in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, industrial safety equipment, or safety compliance, like in deep-sea oil rigs or the air—or spacecraft industry, and if its competency is fully exploited, this type of team is close to being aligned with the most optimal business cases.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: The majority of this team focuses on the content. Some team members also perceive and view the cohesion from the relational side, but this is a minority. The cluster of three members, all positioned close to each other and near the content axis, will likely directly and indirectly influence the team.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This is a highly structured, optimizing, and consolidating team. The single exploratory voice within the team will struggle to make itself heard. With only one voice in this area, the team will have difficulty coming up with new ideas and disruptions. However, it will excel at improving and refining existing processes and products, as well as expanding existing customer relationships.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team mainly consists of specialists, which usually leads to a highly dynamic and energetic environment where people are passionate about the topics of their interest. This many specialists together will usually not hesitate to challenge each other. There might sometimes be less attention to long-term strategy and multi-faceted complex challenges but all the more for in-depth expertise, well-researched facts and data and a strong focus on practical execution. This team will likely rely heavily on individual efforts and contributions which will usually deliver excellent results but which might get strained when the team is put under pressure. Here, the two generalists play a crucial role by instinctively focussing on the overall context of the group and naturally looking at the different interpersonal connections. They can help bring the specialists together within a cohesive framework and the broader context, enabling them to deliver their very best performance.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team is heavily concentrated in the optimisation side of the AEM-Cube, with most members positioned in the Content-Optimisation and Relationship-Optimisation quadrants. This composition suggests a strong focus on refinement, consolidation, and efficiency. The team is likely to thrive in environments where structure, stability, and continuous improvement are key, showing strength in managing recurring activities and enhancing existing processes or relationships. One team member contributes from the Content-Exploration quadrant, offering some capacity to introduce new ideas or approaches from a technical or substantive perspective. However, the complete absence of representation in the Relationship-Exploration quadrant limits the team’s ability to sense shifts in customer needs, engage with new external partners, or adapt quickly to emerging opportunities. This lack of outward, explorative energy may hinder the team’s ability to innovate or navigate change-driven environments. Overall, the team dynamic is likely to be thoughtful, steady, and communicative—especially with the presence of members in the people-optimising quadrant—but without added perspectives from the exploration side, there’s a risk of becoming too inward-focused or resistant to change. If strategic growth or innovation is a goal, the team would benefit from bringing in individuals with more explorative, outward-facing contributions.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team has limited capacity to support the full Business Performance Dialogue. Phase 1 – Changing with People, which requires exploratory and relational contributions for driving sales and engaging stakeholders, is currently unrepresented. As a result, the team may struggle to proactively identify and pursue new commercial opportunities. In Phase 2 – Operational Core, a few members are positioned close enough to potentially contribute by providing structure and ensuring reliable execution, though this would require deliberate effort and role clarity. The team’s strength lies firmly in Phase 3 – Structured Delivery, where several members contribute naturally through a focus on quality, consistency, and continuous improvement. While this ensures that existing propositions are delivered with precision and reliability, the absence of early-phase contributors could hinder the team's ability to generate new momentum or respond quickly to changing market demands. Addressing this gap will be essential for sustaining long-term commercial performance.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team displays some imbalance along the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, which focuses on protecting and nurturing innovative ideas, practices, and initiatives within an organization. In the first phase of this dialogue — embracing change through an inventive and research-oriented approach — only one team member contributes. In a team of optimizers, this individual may struggle to have their ideas heard. Further along the dialogue, there are no strong contributors in the operational phase, where testing substantive inventions and developing prototypes typically take shape, though some members positioned nearby may be able to stretch into this role. In the final phase — the relationship-optimization perspective — two members bring critical contributions, focusing on sustaining change by supporting employees, fostering long-term relationships, enhancing service, and maintaining group cohesion. With members willing to stretch and proactive encouragement of the exploratory voice, this team is well-positioned to navigate the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue effectively.


Project: Canon Materials and Process Development Center 
Focus: Summary
Description: This profile is a classical example of a team with asymmetric strategic diversity. The obvious strength of this team is commercial, sales, or other activities requiring relationships, networking, en communication. If investors see a team like this as a start-up, they often are enchanted by the energy and ideas. The core group of five at the relationship axis, close together on the same strategic position, has a full diversity on the vertical axis, which contributes to the commercial strength of this group with some more competitively focused team members, while others are more integrating. Although these people position themselves are on the same strategic position, they will, as personalities, be very different. This social-cultural diversity within this small group will dominate the character and climate of the team as a whole. This team climate will be forward-looking, highly active, full of ideas, and relationship issues with the external world. This team will have substantial challenges in structuring their work or that of their clients. This team is at risk of opportunism, which could risk core values and integrity.There is a huge operational gap between the dominant exploratory group and the small number of team members in the more controlling, stability-focused second half of the growth curve. They could have problems structuring the load of unstructured activities from the exploratory group. Overall, structure, order, or logical flow from idea and opportunity to implementation will be difficult, challenging, or even at the risk of failing in this team. There is a possibility that some of the exploratory people will adopt more operational roles based on the reality that shows that it doesn’t work otherwise, which will show up if a feedback profile is generated. This strategic compensation is no solution because exploratory people are not specialized in operations, even if they have intentions and a sense of urgence to take that on. A team with such an asymmetry plus the operational gap is often at risk of reaching the desired performance.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This is a primarily relationship-oriented team, often seen in strongly commercial teams. Having so many team members with nearly the same profile does not mean that the individuals themselves are all alike. However, in the way decisions are ultimately made, everyone gravitates toward prioritizing relationships with others or the customer and their needs. This concentration is slightly balanced out by the two team members on the content-oriented side, which is an important aspect for such a team, but it is uncertain whether their voices are sufficiently recognized and integrated in the decision making.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This is a highly innovative team. There is a strong exploratory input, but the step toward practical application is being made as well. This concentration is slightly complemented by team members at the top of the S-curve - the optimizing individuals, but the limited strategic diversity may result in a highly motivated, innovative, and communicative team, that is held back by a notable weakness in operational implementation. In larger organizations, this can often be compensated for.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team shows a reasonable diversity along the Managing Complexity dimension. This indicates that the team will be quite good in facilitating an effective strategic dialogue with a reasonable amount of depth. There are two highly generalized contributions, which will naturally oversee the larger picture and the strategic context of the team. There are also three contributions with middle to middle-specialised contributions, which will be able to provide more focused and in-depth contributions, helping to enhance the execution power of the team and its capacity to go deeper into specific subject areas. There are two main challenges the team needs to be aware of: firstly, there are no true specialists in the team, indicating that the strategic discussion can at times stay more on the surface rather than go really in-depth. Adding one or two strong specialists will help to challenge and sharpen the strategic discussion, allowing for more strategic efficiency. Secondly, there is quite a large gap between the middle contributions and the two generalist contributions, which might make it challenging at times to understand each other and keep focusing on the same priorities. People can stretch themselves to overcome both these potential pitfalls but it is crucial to stay aware of them in order to do so.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This is a very homogeneous team with most of the teammembers clustered together in the relationship-exploratory quadrant, supported by slight diversity on the more optimizing side of the profile. This leads to a very one-sided dialogue where everyone contributes in a similar way. Such a non-diverse group is often hardly able to be optimally effective when it comes to achieving collective results. The few contributions to the optimizing side are essential to convert the group's exploration into results but will often be overshadowed by the larger group of explorers. 

Focus: Business Performance
Description: A Business Performance Dialogue is theoretically possible within this team, as there are contributions in both Phase 1 – Changing with People and Phase 3 – Structured Delivery. However, the dialogue is likely to be difficult in practice due to a significant imbalance: Phase 1 is heavily represented, while Phase 3 has only minimal presence. More critically, Phase 2 – the Operational Core is underrepresented, leaving a gap in the middle of the dialogue where structure, coordination, and practical execution should occur. This absence may hinder communication and collaboration between the exploratory and delivery-focused contributors, making it challenging to translate ideas into consistent, high-quality outcomes. Bridging this operational gap will be essential for the team to engage in a smooth and effective business performance dialogue.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team currently lacks the foundation for a well-functioning Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue. Phase 1 – Inventive Exploration, which involves initiating and experimenting with new ideas, is entirely unrepresented. There is one team member who can potentially stretch into Phase 2 – Operational Testing, but this contribution is limited and not strongly anchored. In Phase 3 – Sustaining with People, there is only one contributor. While this person can stretch across the dialogue to some extent, one individual alone cannot sustain all phases effectively. For this dialogue to succeed, all three phases need to be actively covered, with sufficient capacity to support both early-stage innovation and long-term embedding in parallel. As it stands, this team is not equipped to manage the full safeguarding innovation cycle without additional support or reinforcement.


Project: Canon System Development Center 1
Focus: Summary
Description: The profile shows a team with a strong bias between content-driven, exploratory team members versus a group of relationships focused on supporting and optimizing members, separated by a substantial execution gap. There are no substantially dominant team members in the right-back or left-front areas of the strategic diversity plane, which leaves a team where the main communication runs from right front to left back which is often named the conflict axis. Many strategic perspectives of the content-focused exploratory subgroup are almost completely from a different angle than the relationship focuses optimizing group and have the characteristic of escalating differences in conflict. The strategic dialogue here will be out of balance with different priorities and attention to the different phases of the growth curve. There is also a substantial execution gap, which will also diminish the total output of the team.The vertical axis in this team is just above the average in the exploratory group and just below average in the relationship-focused optimizing group. The vertical axis in the exploratory group could mitigate conflicts or misunderstandings somewhat because this group does not behave completely as specialists.A working option in a team like this is that the optimizing relationship-focused group behaves as a full-service support group to the exploratory group, accepting the latter's lead. This has been observed in some professional organizations with a partner structure, where the optimizing group delivered top support, accepting a hierarchical structure.In general, a profile like this can create strong exploratory and creative ideas, which may fail because of conflictuous misunderstandings and a lack op operational performance. A conscious intervention might be needed to optimize the diversity either within the team or by putting the team in an external context where its strength could be harvested and further optimized by other teams.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: Purely from the perspective of the relationship axis axis, there is a balance. This team will be well-equipped to bridge the gap between the content and the people who need to work with it or are influenced by it. This creates the foundation for a strong product-customer dialogue, where the needs of the customer are well understood and can be quickly addressed from the product side.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: Overall, we see a nice spread along the exploration dimension, which can bring a lot of dynamics and depth to the speed-to-market dialogue. However, an execution gap can be observed, which calls for additional focus when it comes to operationalizing new ideas. Furthermore, there is a higher concentration of people focused on optimization rather than on exploration or innovation, which will lead to more emphasis being placed on improving existing products and processes rather than creating new ones.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: In this team, almost everyone scores in the middle of the managing complexity axis. There is only one true specialist as an exception. This will feel comfortable and unanimous for the team members themselves; people will often understand each other well and need few words to discuss the strategic challenges and priorities of the team. However, it may lead to a somewhat one-sided strategic dialogue with less depth than we would see if there were more spread. In order to achieve optimal capabilities when it comes to managing complex challenges, a group needs diversity along this dimension: it requires the group to focus on in-depth-, detail- and execution related activities as well as to embed these into the wider strategic context. People can stretch themselves along this dimension in the AEM-Cube but it does require them to be aware of the situation and to enable and encourage each other to do so.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: The left quadrants - the opimising side - are dominant in the team. This means that the team mainly focuses on optimization, structuring, and working through processes. Blind spots are certainly found in the exploratory, people-oriented area, where there is no one, which will lead to the team not proactively pursuing people-oriented initiatives, such as commercial opportunities, cultural change, and so on. Furthermore, there is no one in the middle, which could lead to an execution gap between teammembers.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team currently lacks natural contributions across all three phases of the Business Performance Dialogue: Phase 1 – Changing with People, which focuses on engaging stakeholders, initiating new ideas, and generating momentum, has no representation. Phase 2 – Operational Core, where ideas are translated into structured plans and reliably executed, is similarly unrepresented. Phase 3 – Structured Delivery, which ensures consistency, quality, and long-term business performance through critical evaluation and systematisation, is also without contributors. Without natural contributors in any of these key areas, the team is not equipped to carry the full business performance cycle from idea to execution. This means the group may struggle to generate client-focused initiatives, operationalise them effectively, or ensure their consistent and sustainable delivery. To manage this dialogue successfully, the team would need to either introduce members with strong alignment to each of the three phases or build deliberate structures and cross-functional support to compensate for these gaps. Otherwise, it risks significant challenges in aligning strategic intent with practical results.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team holds the essential ingredients for a successful Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, with contributions present in both Phase 1 – Inventive Exploration and Phase 3 – Sustaining with People. The team combines forward-thinking, content-driven innovation with a strong orientation toward implementation, stakeholder alignment, and long-term adoption. However, the absence of contributors in Phase 2 – Operational Testing presents a significant challenge. This middle phase plays a critical bridging role—translating innovative ideas into workable concepts and building the necessary structures for implementation. Without natural representation here, the team may struggle to move seamlessly from ideation to sustainable adoption. To address this, the team will need to consciously create mechanisms for operational translation or bring in additional support to cover this vital transitional phase.


Project: Hays
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a team with a diversity that primarily lies in innovation and development. It is a team with a high level of energy and dynamism, which could potentially lead to a certain degree of incoherence—where individual members move ahead too quickly on their own without informing others. A small group scoring high on generalist traits can, however, maintain cohesion within the team. One risk in this group is the lack of team members in the optimization-content quadrant—those who naturally focus on monitoring, enforcing rules and procedures, and ensuring quality control across services or products. As a result, financial aspects may also be overlooked within the team. On the positive side, this team is unlikely to become rigid or stuck in conventional routines. However, if too many innovations are not further developed, this can lead to over-investment or failing to achieve the desired results despite significant efforts.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This is a team with a dominant focus on relationships, with a smaller but significant content-driven group. The team excels in managing market connections and fostering relationships, ensuring that their work is relevant to external stakeholders and users. However, the content-focused subgroup provides the specialized knowledge and expertise necessary for the team to create meaningful products or services. The dynamic between the two groups ensures that while the team remains highly engaged with market needs and user experiences, it also maintains a strong foundation of content expertise to support those relationships effectively.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This is a profile that covers the entire innovation chain through the S-curve, with the operations following innovation also being solidly covered. Optimization is the least dominant factor in this team. This distribution allows for successful collaboration from exploration to optimization, where the focus on exploration will enable the team to adapt well to new situations, but at times, the emphasis on details and efficiency may take a backseat.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: Throughout the entire profile of this team, strategic agility is noticeable. We see a wide range of specialists to generalists, which will lead to an in-depth and efficient strategic dialogue. The high diversity along this dimension provides a basis for a very efficient strategic dialogue: this is a team that will be comfortable and skilled at handling complex and unexpected situations. However, the higher the diversity in the group, the more critical it becomes that team members trust and understand each other. It is imperative that they actively listen to each other, that they are aware where and how everyone can contribute optimally and they enable and encourage each other to do just that.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: Three of the four quadrants are widely occupied by a diversity of team members. The supportive quadrant provides a solid backbone to the climate. The people-oriented exploratory quadrant is strong in commercial power and building and maintaining relationships. There is some attention to technical content exploration and innovation. The only segment that lags behind is the content-optimization quadrant. While this may prevent the organization from becoming too procedural, it could also lead to an underestimation of the need for some level of structuring.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is well-positioned to support the first two phases of the Business Performance Dialogue. In Phase 1 – Changing with People, members contribute the relational and exploratory energy needed to engage others and initiate momentum. Phase 2 – Operational Core is also well represented, with members who can translate ideas into structured plans and oversee reliable execution. The main challenge lies in Phase 3 – Structured Delivery, which focuses on long-term consistency, data-driven decision-making, and embedding quality and performance across systems. Currently, this phase is represented by only one team member, which risks it being under-prioritized or insufficiently embedded in daily operations. To fully close the loop on business performance, the team may benefit from reinforcing this final phase—either by assigning clear responsibilities or expanding its representation.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team has representation across all three phases of the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, forming a solid foundation for guiding innovation from idea to implementation. In Phase 1 – Inventive Exploration, a few team members contribute by generating new ideas and exploring fresh directions. While not the dominant group, they provide the creative spark needed to initiate innovation. Phase 2 – Operational Testing is supported by team members who help translate these ideas into practical steps, building processes and assessing feasibility. Their presence ensures that innovation can begin to take shape in a structured way. The team is slightly more concentrated in Phase 3 – Sustaining with People, where members naturally focus on embedding innovations into the organisation, aligning them with stakeholder needs, and maintaining long-term impact. This balance leans toward ensuring that once innovations are introduced, they are effectively adopted and supported. Overall, the team is well-positioned to manage this dialogue, with thoughtful representation across phases. Strengthening the earlier phases further could enhance the team’s ability to consistently deliver and embed meaningful innovation.


Project: Zotefoams
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a highly exploratory team that is able to generate new ideas and operationalise them. It will be highly energized around looking for new chances and opportunities and does not mind taking risks. It will be very good at facilitating a successful produc-client dialogue due to its high diversity along the attachment dimension. This is a team that will be very comfortable launching new ideas, projects and other initiatives and cover both the process, product and client sides of the discussion. However, it will run into challenges when it comes finishing and optimizing projects, monitoring progress and building long-term client relationships with a keen eye for detail. Finally, there is a very nice spread along the vertical dimension, indicating that this group is able to facilitate deep strategic dialogues and successfully navigate complex challenges and situations: it just needs to encourage every team member to stay authentic and close to their natural strengths.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: The Attachment dimension is the most important dimension for understanding the market and customer needs. This team is fairly well-balanced with an extremely slight skew towards the lower scores. However, this difference is so small and nuanced it is almost negligible: there are almost equal amounts of contributions to the content side as there are to the relationship side, with a couple of contributions in the middle that will prove highly valuable in bridging these different perspectives. As long as people are encouraged to both stay authentic and close to their natural contribution and to listen and understand different perspectives and viewpoints, this team will have a very powerful basis for a deep and successful product-client dialogue (when looking externally) or process-employee dialogue (when looking internally).

Focus: Speed-to-Market 
Description: This team shows a high level of exploration. The team is highly focused on innovation and is open to new ideas and changes. This is a team that will likely come up with new ideas and concepts on a regular basis. However, the downside of this is that the team may struggle to implement or optimize these ideas and/or processes to the fullest. There are a few contributions in the middle of this dimension so it will be able to execute and take these ideas from incubation to operationalization but this team will be so focused on exploring new possibilities that it may lose sight of the practical demands of delivering solutions in a timely or efficient manner. This could lead to delays in the team's output and a tendency to either overpromise and underdeliver and/or gain maximum value out of all these new initiatives.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team is well-equipped to handle complex challenges. The large diversity on the vertical dimension enables the team to approach these challenges both from a more abstract, integrative, strategic and high-over point of view whilst balancing that with the more tactical, in-depth, expertise driven perspectives required to really understand and act on them. Together, they enable a very deep strategic dialogue. Sometimes, this can create some healthy friction or tension but it is important for team members to keep in mind that disagreements are necessary in order to approach these challenges from different perspectives and to keep challenging the team’s assumptions. When team members recognize these disagreements, it is critical that they recognize them for what they are, point them out and make sure that they never become personal and always stay focused on the task or challenge at hand.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team is characterized by a strong presence in the Relationship-Exploration quadrant, which is on of the quadrants where the most radical and disruptive ideas are generated. This quadrant is all about exploring new possibilities and opportunities, and the team members in this area are likely to be the ones who both come up with new ideas and initiatives and can really make other people enthusiastic about them. This team also has a few members in the Content-Exploration quadrant, which is also an important area for technical ideas and inventions. The fact that there are no members in the Relationship-Optimization quadrant could lead to a lack of attention to the relationships and group dynamics within the team. This is the quadrant where people are most focused on maintaining harmony and ensuring that everyone in the group is heard and feels included. The lack of people in this quadrant could potentially lead to conflicts being ignored or not addressed, or to certain team members feeling left out or not heard. It also could lead to less attention and priority to building out long-term client relationships. The fact that there are almost no people in the Content-Optimization quadrant could lead to a lack of attention to detail and a tendency to overlook important practicalities. This is the quadrant where people are most focused on ensuring that things are done correctly and according to plan, and that all the necessary steps are taken to achieve the desired outcome. The lack of people in this quadrant could potentially lead to important details being overlooked, or to the team not following through on its commitments: the one outspoken contribution in this quadrant has a very important and valuable role to play and should be recognized as such. To balance this team, it would be helpful to bring in some people who are more focused on the practicalities and the details, as well as some people who are more focused on the relationships and the group dynamics.

Focus: Business Performance 
Description: This team is well-equipped to contribute in the first phase of the business performance dialogue, where the focus is on changing with people and enthusing other people around new ideas. The high number of team members with high Exploration scores means that the team is likely to be full of people who are good at generating new ideas and are comfortable with change. However, the team is less equipped to contribute in the second phase, the operational core. This is the phase where these initial ideas are built out and turned into tangible results: this requires a more structured and planned approach, which might not the team’s strong suit. The team is able to contribute in the later phases, where the priorities shift to optimizing processes, structuring delivery and maximizing efficiency: here the focus is on ensuring that things are delivered on time and according to plan, but given that there is only one contribution here it is critical that this voice is not drowned out in the crowd. The strength of this team in the business performance dialogue definitely lies in the earlier phases and the later phases could get less priority than they might need. To address this, the team could consider bringing in people from outside the team to help with these later phases, or could encourage team members to stretch themselves and develop their skills in this area.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation 
Description: This team has is distributed mostly along the first two phases of the safeguarding innovation dialogue, with the later phases not getting nearly the same attention. The majority of team members are inclined towards the Inventive phase of this dialogue, with a few contributions focused on the Operational phase. This is a team that will be very good at testing and operationalizing new ideas and initiatives. However, there are very few members who are naturally inclined towards the Sustaining with People phase. This could be a potential gap, as this phase is crucial for the successful embedding of innovations. To address this, the team could consider introducing a new perspective that is more focused on people and relationships. This could be done by assigning a team member to take on this role, or by seeking input from other teams or departments that have a stronger focus on this phase.


Project: EO Pilot
Focus: Summary
Description: 

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: The average Attachment score of this team is 64.6, which indicates that the team is generally quite customer-oriented. There is a significant portion of the team that scored above 75 on this dimension, which means that they are highly focused on the needs of the customer. This customer-centricity can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it ensures that the team is always thinking about the customer when making decisions, which is essential for creating products and services that meet market needs. On the other hand, there is a risk that the team will be too focused on the customer and lose sight of the business side of things. Are the products and services they are creating actually feasible and profitable? Are they managing the internal complexities of the organization effectively? These are questions that may not be top of mind for this team, which could lead to blind spots and potential challenges in the future.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team is very well equipped to bring new ideas to the table and turning them into tangible results. They are inventive, enjoy exploring new possibilities, and are comfortable with uncertainty. They are eager to start new things and are willing to take risks, are not afraid to challenge the status quo and is comfortable with change. Additionally, this team can also take the first steps into operationalizing these ideas and thinking about how they could become reality. These qualities are ideal for innovation, but can sometimes lead to a lack of focus and a tendency to start many projects at the same time without finishing them. To ensure that these processes are optimized and these innovative ideas actually deliver the best results they can, it can be helpful to involve team members with a more optimizing approach in the team's activities. They can help the team to stay on track and make sure that the great ideas that this team generates are actually implemented, refined and optimized.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team has a good mix of people who prefer dealing with highly complicated problems (specialists), as well as people who prefer dealing with complex problems (generalists). Specialists may prefer to go more in-depth, act fast and focus on the result areas that concern them while generalists may prefer a more reflective, dialogue driven approach that may take more time. This diversity in contributions along this dimension can lead to misunderstandings, friction and frustration between team members, especially when the team is put under stress. However, if managed well, this mix (and the potential friction that arises from it) can also be the basis for highly effective problem-solving, where the team is able to dissect and understand the complexity of the problems they encounter, while also being able to translate this complexity into clear and actionable steps for the rest of the team to follow. This will require strong leadership, a culture of trust and psychological safety, and a shared understanding of the value of different perspectives when dealing with problems

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team has a diverse spread across the five quadrants of the AEM-Cube with at least one contribution in each quadrant. As a result, the team is capable of covering all areas, from focusing on optimizing relationships to exploring new content; this diversity is a foundation for successful collaboration. However, the spread of this team is skewed quite heavily towards the ‘Relationship-Exploration’ quadrant. This indicates a strong drive to explore new ground in the area of relationships and can result in the team behaving very entrepreneurial, very commercial or even opportunistic. The strength of this team will lie in launching new initiatives with other people, whether that be colleagues or clients. The ‘Operational Core’ of the AEM-Cube is also well-represented, which means that the team is able to take these initiatives and operationalize them; the first steps into turning an idea into tangible results. However, even though the team has people in the other quadrants as well, they are underrepresented, creating the risk that projects are not fulfilled to their maximum potential or seen through to the very end. Depending on its result areas, the team could consider inviting people to strengthen these quadrants. This will help the team to create an optimal balance and reduce the risk of overlooking the importance of maintaining relationships, structuring the team and bringing in new disruptive content and ideas while focusing on exploring new people-based opportunities.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team exhibits a skewness towards Exploration and Relationships. This allows the team to effectively navigate the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue, which involves initiating change and projects. This phase benefits from the significant contributions of members with high scores on both dimensions; it is these individuals that are likely to be the driving force behind new initiatives. The team also has the ability to effectively manage the second phase, where the focus is on operational excellence and the successful delivery of projects and results. In this phase, the contributions of team members with mid-range scores on both dimensions are crucial. The team will face challenges in the third phase, which involves consolidating and optimizing existing structures and processes. The contributions of members with lower scores on both dimensions will be essential for maintaining a healthy balance along this dialogue; without them the team will consistently run into the challenge of enthusiastically and energetically launching new ideas and initiatives but either not getting the most out of them, not having enough eye for details or not embedding the processes enough for it to become as efficient as it could otherwise be.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is quite underrepresented when it comes to the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue. There are a number of contributions in the operational phase, which will be beneficial for taking any new ideas and operationalizing them. However, there is a gap in the initial inventive phase, which is important for generating these new ideas and initiating the innovation dialogue. To address this gap, the team could consider inviting more exploratory-content focused perspectives to the table, especially during the early stages of the innovation process. This could involve collaborating with other teams or individuals who naturally contribute to this phase, or encouraging team members to adopt a more exploratory mindset when needed. Additionally, whilst there are two contributions in later phase of this dialogue the team needs to reflect on whether this is enough to consolidate these new ideas and make sure that clients are getting the most out of them. Finally, given that almost all contributions to this dialogue are in the operational phase, the team could benefit from enhancing its ability to transition smoothly between the different phases of the innovation dialogue, ensuring that valuable ideas are not lost along the way.


Project: Beer Group
Focus: Summary
Description: Even though this team doesn’t have that many people, it is excellently spread out over the Exploration dimension. This indicates that this team is very well set up to move from idea ideation to operationalization to implementation and optimization. The strategic dialogue here will be balanced with equal priorities and attention to each of these phases, as long as people are capable and encouraged to contribute to their natural strengths. This team is extremely content-focused, however, indicating that the product-client dialogue will be more difficult to execute effectively. This team will be very good and enthusiastic in discussing the content-sides of the business, whether this be the products, the results, the processes, the protocols, relevant or interesting data, etc. The challenge here is that in doing so, the people side of the business (both the clients’ feelings, emotions, wishes, etc. as well as the dynamics and sentiments within the company) will sometimes be pushed to the background. The team should make a conscious effort that enough attention and priority is given to these aspects when necessary. Finally, even though there are a few more specialists than generalists in this team, overall the spread along the vertical dimension is good. This indicates that this team is very capable of engaging in a healthy and deep strategic dialogue and is capable of tackling complex challenges. It needs to make sure that deep focus on details and practicalities doesn’t become the only point of attention and that the team always stays aware of the bigger picture in which it operates. 

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: The Attachment dimension is about the team's ability to connect the content of the business (it’s products and services) with the customer, to understand their needs and to anticipate their wishes. This team is not very well-balanced on this dimension The majority of the team members have a low Attachment score, which means that they are very content-focused. This can be a good thing if the team is working on a project that requires a lot of expertise, knowledge, structure and data, but it can also be a pitfall. If the team is working on a project that is customer- oriented, they may too little attention to the customer's needs and/or not prioritize them enough. There are a few members with a bridging contribution between content and relationship which are very valuable but reality will have to point whether those are enough to address this gap in the strategic dialogue: if not, it will be necessary for people to stretch themselves along this dimension.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team is well-balanced on the dimension of Exploration. The team consists of members who are more focused on the present and the existing business, while also having members who are more future-oriented and focused on new ideas. This balance is important for the team's ability to deliver results. The team is able to think about the future and come up with new ideas, while also being able to translate these ideas into practical solutions for the present. The one area where it is not as well-positioned is in the latest phases of the Growth-Curve (the optimizing side of the AEM-Cube), which could lead to less attention to details and potentially not getting the absolute maximum in results out of existing and running projects and initiatives. Overall, however, this team is well-equipped to balance new ideas with the practical demands of delivering solutions in a timely and efficient manner.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team is reasonably well-balanced in terms of managing complexity. Four team-members scores low on this dimension, one scores high and two score more in the middle. This will help team-members to understand each other’s viewpoints which is necessary in order to deliver a deep strategic dialogue. The team will often run into differing opinions and sometimes even frictions but there is a solid basis for working through them and finding a common ground when solving complex problems. This will not make it easy to come to decisions, as those who prefer complexity can approach challenges and situations from an angle that others find too abstract, high-over and strategic, and those who prefer dealing with complicated challenges can come across as too focused, too tactical and not thinking about the big picture enough. However, given the balance in this team it has all the ingredients to efficiently tackle these challenges, as long as people trust and understand each other.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team has a clear skewness towards the Content-side of the AEM-Cube, with contributions in the Content-Exploration quadrant and the Content-Optimization quadrant. This team will be heavily focused on the content and will be less inclined to take the initiative to monitor the relationships, dynamics and atmosphere within the team. The team is missing people in the Relationship-Optimization and the Relationship-Exploration quadrants. This means that there is a risk that this team will not be able to take on tasks that require a focus on actively seeking out new (client) relationships or really rallying and enthusing people around the team’s vision and cause or a focus long-term relationships, whether this means clients or employees. To improve the team's performance, it is recommended to add people to these latter quadrants in order to bring more balance to the Product-Client dialogue within the team.

Focus: Business Performance 
Description: This team is very well equipped to cover the the second halve of the Business Performance Dialogue, with a clear division of roles in the different phases. The team has a number of members who are able to operationalize any ideas that are generated, ensuring that results are being delivered. The team also has a few members who can bridge the second and third phases, ensuring that projects are successfully executed and efficiently optimized. However, the team does not have anyone who naturally contributes to the first phase. This could result in a lack of focus on generating new ideas and disrupting the status quo. To address this, it would be beneficial to encourage the team to actively seek out this contribution from other teams when needed or make agreements on who should stretch himself or herself towards this position.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is very well balanced in terms of the distribution across the the first two phases. There are two team members who are more focused on the Inventive phase and two members who are more focused on the Operational phase. This will help in generating new product- or process-focused ideas and operationalizing them. However, the team is less balanced when it comes to the final phase of this dialogue: this area is completely empty. This might lead to the situation when new technical inventions are not communicated effectively enough to the people impacted by- or working with them. To address this, the team could consider assigning roles based on these result areas and assigning people to these roles, either through people within the current team stretching themselves or by (temporarily) attracting talents from outside the team. This will help to ensure that the transition from research and experimentation to practical, sustainable and efficient implementation is successful.


Project: Vebego leadership community
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a highly exploratory team that is able to generate new ideas and try them out. It will be highly energized around looking for new chances and opportunities and does not mind taking risks. This team is great at facilitating a successful product-client dialogue due to its high diversity along the attachment dimension. This is a team that will be very comfortable launching new ideas, projects and other initiatives and cover both the process, product and client sides of the discussion. However, it will run into challenges when it comes to operationalizing, finishing and optimizing projects as effectively and efficiently as possible, monitoring progress and building long-term client relationships with a keen eye for detail. Finally, even though there is some diversity along the vertical dimension, the large majority of contributions in this team are highly generalist in nature and there are no real “bridging” contributions. This creates a potential risk for a less-than-optimal discussion where the specialists and generalists may have to pay extra attention and spend extra energy in understanding each other. Finally, it is important that the specialists are not drowned out by the generalists to maintain balance in the discussion, get maximum depth out of the team’s strategic dialogue and maximize its ability to manage complex challenges.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team is reasonably well-balanced when it comes to the Attachment dimension. There is a large group of team members who score relatively high on this dimension, which means they are more focused on the needs of the customer and the market. This is a good thing, as this is an important aspect of any organization. It is most critical for teams dealing with clients and partners but even for teams that do not, these contributions will help to focus on the internal dynamics of the team. There is also a significant group of team members who score more towards the content-side of the AEM-Cube. These team members will instinctively be more focused on the products, processes, data and relevant technology for the team. While just as critical for the team’s performance and results they might not always understand prioritize the importance of the customer perspective as much as more relationship-focused people, which could lead to misunderstandings or frictions when it comes to the team’s priorities and strategic decisions. This could potentially lead to a mismatch between what the team is building and what the customer actually needs. Even though all the ingredients are present, attention must be paid to make sure communication is healthy so no misunderstandings can arise between the different mindsets and contributions.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team is likely to be very effective in exploring new products, services and initiatives. The majority of the team members are in the top half of the Exploration dimension (the bottom half of the Growth-Curve), indicating that they are likely to be actively searching forto new ideas and ways of working and keen to test these out to see what works best. They are also likely to be able to think out of the box, are not afraid to take risks and will often come up with new solutions to problems. However, the fact that there are no team members in the operational area phase of the Exploration dimension could mean that they struggle to ground their ideas in reality and to get efficient, tangible results from them. This could potentially lead to them being seen as a bit 'pie in the sky' by other teams. The fact that there is only one (extremely valuable) team member in the final phase could also mean that they struggle to finish and optimize projects, miss important details and reach less efficiency than they otherwise could potentially achieve.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team can run into challenges when dealing with complex situations and challenges. The majority of the team (62%) scores in the top quartile, which means that they will be able to assess, interpret and reflect on complex problems with relative ease. However, the lack of people in the lower quartiles might mean that the group as a whole might not reach the maximum depth of the strategic dialogue. A group with such a high number of highly generalist contributions runs the risk of being too reflective, too abstract and too strategic in its dialogue; it needs more specialist contributions to challenge the assumptions based on their deep-rooted experience and expertise. It is the balance of generalists and specialists that can help assess complex situations from multiple angles and then form an actual plan of action: without specialists, this group can get caught in high-over discussions and dialogue without going in-depth and moving to acting on these discussions. Finally, it needs bridging contributions to help bring these different mindsets together and help facilitate an effective strategic discussion. The lack of these bridging contributions in this team might lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team is quite heavily skewed towards the Relationship-Exploration quadrant. This is a team that is very focused on people and relationships and is therefore very suitable for roles that require a lot of interaction with others in a high-pace environment, such as sales or marketing. The team is less suited for roles that require a lot of focus on content and structure, such as finance or IT. This team will be very good at enthusing people, bringing in new business and exploring new relationships with clients, but will struggle with the more technical aspects of the job. To balance this team (and depending on its key result areas), it would be good to add some people from the Content-Optimization quadrant, who are more focused on content and structure, and some people from the Relationship-Optimization quadrant, who are more focused on monitoring client relationships and building out long lasting relationships in a more structured and organized manner.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is very well equipped to perform in the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue, Changing with People. With half of the team members contributing in this phase, the team will be able to easily drive change and keep everyone involved and motivated. The second phase, the Operational Core, is where this team will start to face some challenges. With only a few team members contributing in this phase, the team will struggle to convert the ideas from the first phase into concrete projects and will have a hard time ensuring that these projects are executed efficiently. The third phase, Structured Delivery, is where the team will face the most challenges. With no team members contributing in this phase, the team will struggle to keep track of all the projects and tasks that are currently in progress and will have a hard time delivering these projects on time and according to the agreed standards. To address these gaps, it is recommended to involve team members from other teams that do contribute in these phases, or to assign specific team members to focus on these contributions.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is strongly focused on the operational testing phase; this is where the majority of the team is contributing to this dialogue, with two people also very close to the inventive-explorative phase. There are no natural contributions in the last phase (the “sustaining” phase) of this dialogue. This means that whilst this team will be very capable of coming up with technical and process-oriented ideas and initiatives, it will have a hard time of operationalizing these and optimizing these. It needs to be wary that the teams desire and vision for these ideas doesn’t replace the focus on client needs and wishes. Also, it needs to pay attention to making sure that all ideas are optimally communicated to clients and that they are serviced to the highest standard, things that might not get priority in this team’s strategic focus and discussions. It would help the team to bring in one or two contributions in this area or to have people consciously stretch into this area when needed. If it is the latter, the entire team needs to be aware of this and needs to encourage and support the people taking on these result areas.


Project: Swisslife
Focus: Summary
Description: When we look at this group profile of this team, we can see that there are some clusters within the AEM-Cube where the participants see themselves contributing to. When looking at the datapoints, we see that there is a cluster in the top right of the AEM-Cube. People in this top right corner want to lead and explore, and are good change leaders and drivers of change within organisations. We also see a cluster of people contributing to the middle left of the AEM-Cube (when looking at the top view). This group is great at optimising the existing business, a has a natural focus to maintain the status quo, focussing on making things better via small steps. There are also some individuals in the bottom right quadrant. These are the content explorative contributors that think about products possibilities and have the need to enhance and build out service offerings with new options. Also, we see that the on the right side of the AEM-Cube there are more generalists, people that focus more on the bigger scheme of things, with on the left side of the AEM-Cube a nice counter balance with more specialistic contribution. It is interesting to see if the team is really capable to leverage this natural diversity and effectuate this in their daily operations and team sessions.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit 
Description: This team shows a well-balanced distribution along the Attachment axis, reflecting a healthy mix of perspectives. Some members are relationship-oriented, focusing on customer needs, usability, and market relevance. They ask vital questions like: Are we meeting real needs? How can we improve the user experience? These are complemented by the team members that take a content-driven approach, emphasizing product quality, technical soundness, and internal improvement. They ensure that what’s delivered is robust, efficient, and continually refined. Crucially, the team also includes several ‘Bridge Builders’—individuals who can move fluidly between these two mindsets. They help translate customer insights into practical solutions and align external expectations with internal capabilities. Their presence fosters constructive dialogue and strengthens the team’s ability to deliver solutions that are both valuable and viable. To maintain this strength, the team should continue to support and empower these bridging roles, as they are key to turning diverse perspectives into cohesive action.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team exhibits a diverse range of Exploration scores, with a slight bias towards the extremes. Approximately 35% of the team members have high Exploration scores, indicating a tendency to embrace change, seek out new possibilities, and engage in creative thinking. These individuals are likely to be the driving force behind the team’s innovative ideas and initiatives. On the other hand, another 35% of the team members have low Exploration scores, suggesting a preference for stability, structure, and efficiency. These individuals are likely to focus on optimizing existing processes, delivering results in a timely manner, and ensuring that the team’s ideas are practical and feasible. The remaining 30% of the team members have scores in the middle range, which can help bridge the gap between the two extremes and facilitate communication and collaboration. Overall, this team has the potential to balance exploration and optimization effectively, leveraging the strengths of both perspectives to drive innovation while also ensuring that the team’s ideas are delivered in a practical and efficient manner. However, the slight bias towards the extremes could lead to some challenges in reaching consensus and making decisions, particularly if the team members with opposing perspectives are not able to communicate effectively or if the team does not have clear processes in place for managing conflicts and disagreements.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team has a fairly balanced distribution of scores on the Managing Complexity dimension, with a slight skew towards the higher end. This means that the team is well-equipped to facilitate a deep strategic dialogue and manage complex challenges effectively, as there are members who are comfortable dealing with the broad overview and larger context in which the group operates, as well as members who prefer a more in-depth approach focused on expertise and execution. The team is likely to be able to adapt to changing circumstances and make decisions in a timely manner, while also ensuring that these decisions are well thought-out and based on a solid understanding of the situation. The main challenge for this team will be to ensure that the different perspectives are heard and integrated into the decision-making process, as there is a risk that the more dominant voices will drown out the others.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team demonstrates a well-rounded balance across the four quadrants, with a slight emphasis on Relationship–Exploration and Content–Optimisation. This means that this team will have a strong focus on exploring new opportunities and building new relationships, while at the same time being able to optimise existing processes and relationships. This combination of quadrants will make this team very effective in creating new business opportunities and building long-term relationships with clients. The team is also well-equipped to optimise existing processes and relationships, which will help them to deliver high-quality products and services to their clients. The Content–Exploration and Relationship–Optimisation quadrants are somewhat less represented, which may result in those perspectives being less prominent in day-to-day discussions. This could mean that the team is less naturally inclined to explore new technological or product-related opportunities, or to systematically maintain and enhance established client relationships. However, this is not necessarily a weakness—so long as the team proactively brings these perspectives into the conversation when needed.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is particularly strong in the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue, which focuses on initiating change, exploring new ideas, and fostering collaboration. A significant number of team members are energized by innovation and working with others, making this phase a natural strength. However, the team has fewer members contributing to the second phase, which involves operationalising ideas—translating vision into structured plans and maintaining focus on efficiency, productivity, and execution. This underrepresentation suggests a potential risk: the team may be inclined to continuously generate new ideas without always following through effectively. The third phase, which centres on delivering measurable results with accuracy and attention to detail, is also less strongly represented, though not to the same extent. While this may not be a critical gap, it’s an area to keep in mind as ideas move toward delivery. To ensure long-term impact and balance across the full dialogue, the team could benefit from consciously supporting the operational and delivery aspects of their work—either by developing those capabilities internally or involving people who naturally thrive in these later stages.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team shows a strong orientation toward the first phase of the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue — Inventive Exploration. Several team members are well-positioned to generate new ideas, explore possibilities, and initiate change, making this a clear strength. The second phase—Operational Testing—is less strongly represented, though one team member is ideally placed to contribute here, and others may be able to support this phase with some stretching. This suggests that the team has the potential to operationalise ideas, but it may require conscious effort to ensure structure, efficiency, and follow-through. The third phase—Sustaining with People—is the least represented, with only one team member positioned to contribute, and even then with some stretch. This could make it more difficult to embed innovations in a sustainable way and ensure long-term adoption across the organisation. To address these imbalances, the team could benefit from assigning roles that reflect each phase of the dialogue, encouraging development across underrepresented areas, or involving additional support from outside the team. Doing so will help ensure that ideas move beyond early-stage innovation and are successfully implemented and sustained.


Project: Jochem Poelman
Focus: Summary
Description: This team shows a clear preference for the relationship and exploration side of the AEM-Cube. Most team members operate within this quadrant, with only one exception. This suggests that the team is likely strong in collaborating with others and in building connections—both within the organisation and externally. At the same time, it may indicate that they experience more difficulty with optimising internal processes. In addition, the team shows a higher degree of generalist focus, indicating an ability to handle complex issues and view challenges from multiple perspectives. A potential pitfall is that decision-making may happen too hastily due to the team’s exploratory nature. Since only one person offers a counterbalance, this individual will need to have a strong presence to temper the team’s enthusiasm for action and help ensure more measured decisions. Looking at the Growth Curve, it becomes clear that the team is primarily inclined toward the first phase of the process. They excel at generating innovative ideas and solutions, but may face challenges when it comes to translating these into concrete, actionable plans. The team could be strengthened by adding members with a preference for the optimisation and content sides of the AEM-Cube. In addition, it may be valuable to support the development of current team members (such as direct reports, business unit managers, or supervisors) in these directions to foster more balance and diversity within the team.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team shows a strong inclination toward the relationship side, with one team member contributing more from the content side. This suggests that the team likely has a good understanding of customer needs, is aware of market dynamics, and is adept at responding to them—translating these insights into product features and services. The team is probably skilled in communicating with clients and building strong relationships. However, there is a risk that the team may lose sight of the technical aspects of the product and the internal processes required to meet customer needs, which could harm customer relationships in the long run. To mitigate this risk, the team could benefit from placing more emphasis on the technical side of the work—either by bringing in people with a stronger content focus or by fostering a culture that values and prioritises technical excellence.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This is a team with a strong focus on exploration, with three-quarters of the members scoring in the highest quartile. This indicates a team that is highly innovative and constantly seeking new ideas and opportunities. However, the lack of team members contributing to the optimisation side suggests that the team may struggle with the practical and structural challenges required to successfully scale up new services. As a result, the team may excel at idea generation but be less effective at anchoring these ideas in reality and extracting their full value. To address this, the team could benefit from adding members with a more optimisation-oriented mindset, helping to balance the exploratory character and ensuring that ideas are also practically and efficiently tested by those who naturally contribute to this phase.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team is reasonably well-equipped to manage complex problems, with a wide diversity in contributions enabling a solid basis for a very effective strategic dialogue. This means they are both able to approach issues from a high-level, helicopter view, as well as having a counterbalance in the team member with a more specialist contribution, which is especially useful for challenging the existing notions in the team and translating abstract strategic thinking into practical next steps. This combination is critical in achieving optimal efficiency when managing complex issues. With the majority of the team being more generalist focused and only one member with a specialist focus, it’s especially important for the team to remain alert to the risk of groupthink and to actively encourage and invite diverse perspectives and opinions during management team discussions. This is made extra difficult given the fact that there are no real bridging contributions between the two, creating quite a large gap that people must bridge in order to really hear and understand each other. This won't always be necessary for everyday operational matters, but becomes essential when addressing more complex questions that lack straightforward solutions.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team is strongly represented in the Relationship–Exploration quadrant, with 75% of team members falling into this category. This indicates a strong focus on exploring new ideas and opportunities in the area of relationships—such as building and maintaining partnerships, understanding customer needs, and improving team dynamics. The absence of team members in the Content–Exploration quadrant may suggest that there is less emphasis on developing new products or services, improving existing ones, or finding new ways to deliver value to customers. The one team member in the Content–Optimisation quadrant is likely focused on delivering high-quality work and maintaining standards, but may find it more challenging to engage with the more exploratory and relationship-driven aspects of the team. The lack of representation in the Relationship–Optimisation quadrant suggests the team may place less emphasis on optimising existing relationships, such as improving customer satisfaction or addressing internal development issues within the organisation as a whole. If new members are added to the team in the future, it may be worth considering someone with a contribution from the Content axis, ideally with an optimising focus—to serve as a grounding point for the team’s natural exploratory energy.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is strongly oriented toward the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue: Leading Change with People. Most team members are positioned here, indicating strong capabilities in engaging others, building relationships, understanding customer needs, and translating those needs into new ideas and solutions. The second phase—the Operational Core—is represented by only one team member. This phase focuses on turning ideas into action through structured execution, reliability, and discipline. While this individual provides an entry point, the limited representation suggests that operational follow-through might be a challenge for this team. . The third phase—Structured Delivery—is not represented at all. This phase involves critical thinking, attention to detail, and system-level processes needed to embed and scale results. Without this perspective, the team may face challenges in securing sustainable implementation and long-term impact. To ensure continuity from inspiration to execution, the team could benefit from strengthening these underrepresented phases—either by supporting internal development or collaborating closely with others who bring these capabilities.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team has limited representation across the Safeguarding-Innovation Dialogue. There are no team members currently contributing to the first phase—Inventive Exploration—which focuses on generating new ideas and identifying novel solutions. This suggests that innovation may not naturally originate within the team and may need to be sparked through collaboration with others in the organisation who bring a more exploratory mindset. Only one team member is active in the second phase—Operational Testing. This person is likely to play a key role in assessing feasibility and translating ideas into practical steps in collaboration with operational colleagues. However, the team’s ability to test and structure innovation may be fragile, depending heavily on this individual’s contribution. The team is also not represented in the third phase—Embedding with People, which centres on implementing and embedding new solutions within the organisation. This includes ensuring that innovations are accepted, adopted, and sustained by the people working with them—an essential component of long-term impact and organisational alignment. To address these gaps, the team could benefit from bringing in individuals who naturally contribute to the missing phases or by supporting existing members to grow into these roles. It may also be helpful to examine how the AEM-Cube is applied across the wider organisation, beginning with the teams reporting to this one, to identify complementary contributions and strengthen collaboration across phases.


Project: Midsummerstudio
Focus: Summary
Description: The team shows a generally high Attachment profile, indicating a strong customer focus and sensitivity to market needs. A few members score lower, offering a valuable internal, technical perspective. Balancing both angles can strengthen product development and customer alignment. With a strong tilt toward Exploration, the team is rich in innovation and experimentation. However, limited focus on Optimization may hinder efficient implementation. Adding structure and process-minded thinking could help turn ideas into results more effectively. In terms of Complexity Management, the team is fairly balanced but slightly leans toward solving well-structured problems. Strengthening strategic, long-term thinking could boost performance in more complex contexts. Across the AEM-Cube quadrants, the team is capable of delivering on all fronts, with a particular strength in Relationship Exploration. This makes them well-suited for stakeholder engagement and opportunity development, while still being able to handle content, operations, and optimization when needed. The team excels in the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue (innovation and change) but lacks strength in the second and third phases (execution and structured delivery). This could lead to a lack of follow-through. Addressing this gap through skill development or team composition would increase delivery power. Finally, while the team is highly innovative, it could struggle with operationalizing and embedding ideas. Targeted roles or added perspectives can help bridge this gap from idea to sustainable implementation.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team shows a well-balanced distribution along the Attachment axis, reflecting a healthy mix of both high and low Attachment scores. On one end, members with higher Attachment scores bring a strong customer focus, emphasizing relationship-building and a deep understanding of market needs. This orientation ensures that the team’s products and services remain aligned with user expectations and drive customer engagement. At the same time, members with lower Attachment scores contribute a valuable internal focus, emphasizing product quality, technical content, and execution. This ensures the team's output is robust, well-developed, and not solely driven by external demands. This diversity offers complementarity: high Attachment supports responsiveness to the outside world, while low Attachment reinforces internal rigor and product excellence. By consciously integrating these perspectives, the team is well positioned to balance customer needs with technical quality—strengthening both product development and market fit.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team exhibits a strong inclination towards exploration, with half of the members scoring above the 75th percentile. This suggests a focus on innovation, experimentation, and discovering new possibilities. However, there is a lack of balance, with only 20% scoring below the 25th percentile. This could lead to challenges in optimizing processes, delivering solutions efficiently, and ensuring that innovative ideas are translated into practical, timely outcomes. The team may benefit from fostering or incorporating more optimization-oriented perspectives to balance its exploratory nature, ensuring that it can both generate new ideas and effectively implement them in a structured, efficient manner.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team is reasonably well-balanced in terms of managing complexity. Three team members score high on this dimension – reflecting their generalist focus, a few fall in the middle, and two score low—reflecting a more specialist orientation. This diversity enables the team to effectively manage complex challenges, combining strategic insight with a more in-depth, practical focus. While those with higher complexity scores can bring broad, abstract, and long-term thinking, others may favor more focused, expertise-driven and tactical approaches. These differing perspectives can at times lead to friction or disagreements, but they also offer the opportunity for richer dialogue and more robust solutions. With a foundation of mutual understanding and trust, this balance positions the team well to integrate big-picture thinking with grounded execution—an essential combination for addressing complex, evolving challenges.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This is a relatively well-balanced team across most of the quadrants, with a slight emphasis on the Relationship–Exploration quadrant. With several team members positioned here, the team is particularly strong at building and developing new relationships with clients and stakeholders, as well as identifying emerging opportunities. It also includes members anchored in the Content–Exploration quadrant, equipping the team to explore and innovate around ideas, content, and technical solutions. The presence of team members in both the Content–Optimization quadrant and the Operational Core further enables the team to refine existing content and processes and manage day-to-day operations effectively. However, there is a slight underrepresentation in the Relationship–Optimization quadrant, with only one team member anchored there. This may create some limitations in maintaining and systematically improving existing client relationships. To strengthen this area, the team could consider reinforcing relational continuity through dedicated roles or structured collaboration. Overall, while the team is capable across all four result areas, it is likely to deliver the greatest impact in Relationship–Exploration, where its core strengths are most concentrated.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is well-equipped to excel in the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue, which involves change, innovation, and collaboration with others. The team has a significant number of members who are highly engaged and motivated in this phase, which will help drive progress and ensure that the team is always looking for new opportunities. However, the team is less well-equipped to handle the second phase of the dialogue, which involves the operational core. This phase requires a focus on efficiency, productivity, and getting things done, and the team may struggle to maintain momentum and ensure that tasks are completed on time. The lack of members in this phase could lead to delays and a lack of follow-through on initiatives. Finally, the team has no people placed to handle the third phase of the dialogue, which involves structured delivery. This phase requires a focus on planning, organization, and attention to detail, and the team may struggle to ensure that projects are delivered on time and to the required standard. The lack of members in this phase could lead to a lack of structure and discipline, which could impact the team's ability to deliver on its promises. To address these gaps, the team could consider bringing in new members who are more naturally inclined to focus on the operational and structured aspects of the business, or it could look at developing the skills and capabilities of existing team members to ensure that these areas are not neglected.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team includes several members who are naturally oriented toward the early, inventive phase of the innovation cycle, positioning it well for generating new ideas, experimenting, and driving innovation. While there are no team members naturally anchored in the operational testing phase, a few members—with some stretching—could contribute to bridging the gap between exploration and practical implementation. However, the team has no representation in the sustaining-with-people phase, which could present challenges when it comes to embedding innovations within the broader organization or ensuring adoption by those impacted. To mitigate these gaps, the team could benefit from assigning roles that reflect the full innovation cycle—supporting members in extending their focus toward later phases, or temporarily involving individuals from outside the team with strengths in operationalization and integration. This would help ensure that promising ideas not only get developed, but also tested, scaled, and sustainably embedded in practice.


Project: De Baak // Koppert Cress
Focus: Summary
Description: This team is well distributed across both the Growth Curve and the AEM-Cube. We assess this by looking at the spread of the pillars within the cube and the positions mapped along the Growth Curve.
When examining the vertical axis of the AEM-Cube – the managing complexity dimnesion, what stands out is that the more generalist contributions are located on the outer edges of the cube—on both the exploration and the optimisation sides (far left and far right). This indicates that individuals with a helicopter view are positioned on the outer sides, while the members situated in the centre of the cube, particularly within the management team, tend to bring a more specialist contribution. This distribution offers a strategic advantage: those on the outer edges provide oversight and broad impact awareness, while the central group naturally brings in operational questions and practical strategy formation, creating a natural balance within the team. In teams like this, communication tends not to be short or rushed, but rather thoughtful and grounded in trust. Given the healthy diversity within this team, it’s particularly important to reflect on the roles each member plays: Are the right people in the right roles? Who is responsible for what? And which result areas are tied to those roles? Just as importantly—are those result areas currently being well addressed by the management team?

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: Paramount for this dialogue, is how well the team is able to engage in conversations that bridge internal, content-driven discussions and people-oriented perspectives—and vice versa. Think of it like a tennis match, where the ball is continuously hit back and forth across the court. Based on the positions of the team member along the attachment dimension, this team is more than capable of holding this type of dialogue on a daily basis. Three team members bring a strong content-focused contribution, while three others are able to translate this into the relational space. The two team members around the middle of attachment axis are especially valuable as well, because they can serve as the ‘golden bridge’ between these two groups. Their ability to move between both sides helps strengthen mutual understanding and integration. Overall, this group is well-equipped to sustain a healthy and constructive dialogue along this axis.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team shows a well-balanced natural distribution along the exploration axis. Four team members lean more toward the exploratory side, focusing on what’s possible and testing new ideas in the market. This is nicely counterbalanced by the two team members in the middle of the axis, who are able to translate those ideas into actual operations, supported by two other team members, who help ensure that existing processes are not disrupted unnecessarily. They represent the voice of caution—the proverbial “let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.” Based on their positions, this team appears to be naturally capable of engaging in this dialogue, with a slight preference for exploration.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team shows a healthy balance between generalists and specialists, offering a mix of high-level strategic thinkers and more detail-focused contributors. However, it’s worth noting that there are no true specialists—no one scoring particularly low on the managing complexity axis. As a result, the contributions of the four team members with moderately specialist profiles play a key role in grounding the team’s discussions in operational and executional reality. The strategic dialogue within the group will often focus on approaching multifaceted challenges from different angles, though some discussions may lean more toward high-level abstraction unless anchored by those with a stronger operational focus. It is therefore imperative that the people with a more specialised contribution are actively heard and involved in the discussions, sometimes people will need to stretch themselves into this area. These reflections can strengthen the team’s ability to engage in deep strategic dialogue, maintain alignment, and ensure that different perspectives are actively integrated into decision-making and execution.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team shows a well-balanced distribution across the AEM-Cube, with representation in all four quadrants and one member positioned at the centre. There is a notable concentration in the People–Exploration quadrant, suggesting that the team leans toward innovation, relationship-building, and co-creation. This likely makes the team dynamic, future-oriented, and well-equipped to explore new ideas and opportunities collaboratively. However, there are slight underrepresentations in the People–Optimisation and Content–Exploration quadrants. This may result in a few potential blind spots. First, the team may give less attention to the consistent development and optimisation of existing relationships, which are key to maintaining long-term stakeholder engagement. Second, new product or content-driven opportunities may not be fully explored, particularly those that require technical depth or forward-thinking innovation on the content side. To strengthen its strategic diversity further, the team could benefit from reinforcing these underrepresented areas—either by developing current members to stretch into these quadrants, or by considering targeted additions who naturally contribute in these spaces. Doing so would help the team maintain its exploratory edge while becoming more robust in sustaining relationships and identifying content-focused innovations over time.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team has a strong focus on the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue: building relationships with customers, clients, and other stakeholders. This phase is critical, as it lays the foundation for future success. The team is well-equipped to handle this phase, with a good mix of individuals who are comfortable with both the people-oriented and business aspects of relationship-building. The second phase, where customer needs are translated into concrete actions and results, is also well represented. This is a vital phase in which the organisation delivers on its promises. The team could benefit from adding members who feel particularly confident and experienced in this phase, further strengthening execution. In the third phase—Structured and Efficient Delivery of Results—we currently see only one team member contributing naturally. This phase places strong emphasis on the content-focused, analytical side of the dialogue. While the team is capable of addressing this phase, it would benefit from more members who feel confident working with data, structure, and detail—ensuring results are not only delivered, but done so reliably and at scale. All in all, this is a balanced team with clear strengths in phases one and two of the Business Performance Dialogue, but one that would benefit from reinforcement in the final phase.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is moderately equipped for the first phase of the Innovation Dialogue: Inventive Exploration. This phase is all about generating new ideas, exploring possibilities, and pushing boundaries. The team includes one member who leans strongly toward this phase, which supports the generation of innovative ideas and solutions. The team also includes two members with a natural affinity for the second phase: Operational Testing. This phase is essential for turning ideas into practical, workable solutions. However, the team will need to remain aware of the gap between phase one and the rest of the team, and actively focus on the practical implementation of its ideas. The third phase—Sustaining with People—also requires attention. This phase is about embedding solutions sustainably and aligning them with the needs of end users. The team has one member who contributes in this area, but this person will need support to fully bring their perspective into the dialogue. Overall, this team has strong creative and innovative potential, but will need to work on balancing contributions across the different phases to ensure that ideas are not only developed, but also successfully implemented and sustained.


Project: Woonkracht10
Focus: Summary
Description: When we look at the participants’ profiles projected onto the Growth Curve and the AEM-Cube, we see a well-distributed mix of natural contributions, with a noticeable cluster just beyond the first inflection point on the Growth Curve. This suggests that the team has a strong exploratory focus—they are naturally inclined to generate new ideas and explore opportunities. At the same time, there are some operational strengths within the group: team members who can turn ideas into practical next steps and concrete actions. In addition, two members bring a clear optimisation mindset. Their contribution is particularly valuable in balancing the team’s exploratory energy, asking the critical questions needed to move from ideas to execution—“But how are we actually going to do that?” To fully understand how this team operates, it’s important to consider their scope of responsibility. It’s also worth exploring who leads this team: What behaviours do they model? What is their natural preference—do they lean more toward exploration or optimisation? And how do they naturally deal with complexity?

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team shows a diverse spread in Attachment scores, with a slight emphasis on the relationship side. This means the team is generally well-positioned to connect internal expertise with external needs—balancing product development with customer engagement. The Attachment dimension reflects a team’s ability to bridge content (what we do) with relationships (for whom we do it), and this balance can be a real asset for achieving market fit. The relational skew suggests the team is naturally strong in areas like collaboration, stakeholder alignment, and co-creation. However, there’s a risk that technical depth, internal structure, or delivery quality may receive less attention, especially if relational priorities dominate decision-making. The fewer members on the content side, along with those who operate across both ends of the axis, will play a critical role in maintaining balance—grounding ideas in feasibility, structure, and execution. To make this work, the team should ensure these voices are included in key decisions and not overshadowed by the dominant relational perspective. Maintaining open dialogue between content- and relationship-focused members, especially in moments of planning, delivery, or strategic alignment, will help avoid blind spots and ensure that customer value is matched by delivery quality.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team leans slightly toward exploration, with a significant portion of members scoring high in this area. This suggests a team inclined toward innovation, creativity, and experimentation. However, there are also several members who score more toward the optimisation axis, indicating a focus on efficiency, practical execution, and refinement. This diversity in scores can be advantageous, as it creates a balance between exploring new ideas and implementing them in a practical, efficient manner. However, the greater number of high-exploration scores may result in a preference for innovation over optimisation, potentially leading to less focus on timely delivery and execution. To address this, the team could benefit from giving those with a stronger optimisation orientation a more prominent role in decision-making, ensuring their perspectives are heard and considered. This would support more balanced, high-quality decision-making and help prevent the team from moving too quickly without proper grounding. In this context, the more execution-focused members can play a crucial role in asking critical questions—such as whether a given idea truly serves the needs of internal or external stakeholders.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description: This team has a well-balanced distribution of scores on the managing complexity axis, with members spread across the spectrum—from those who are detail-oriented and execution-focused, to those with a broader, strategic, "helicopter" view, as well as individuals who can move flexibly between both. This diversity allows the team to navigate complex challenges effectively. The range of perspectives enables richer strategic dialogue, as team members can approach problems from different angles and go really in-depth when necessary. This may occasionally lead to differing opinions or friction—especially between those who prefer high-level, abstract thinking and those who lean toward practical, tactical execution. However, the balance within the team provides a solid foundation for constructive discussions and finding common ground. Decision-making may take a bit more time as the team works through different viewpoints, but this process ultimately supports stronger, more well-rounded outcomes. Additionally, where the generalists my prove very good in facilitating the dialogue and encouraging different perspectives, the specialists in the group will usually be highly valuable in encouraging the group to make decisions and move fast. With mutual trust and openness to each other’s perspectives, the team is well-positioned to manage complexity with both speed and depth—combining fast decision-making where needed with thoughtful reflection where it counts.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis
Description: This team is well-balanced, with a slight emphasis on the Content and People–Exploration quadrant. This suggests that the team is likely focused on innovation, new ideas, and pushing boundaries. It is probably a dynamic and energetic group, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities. However, there is a potential risk that the importance of building and maintaining relationships—both within the team and with external stakeholders—may be underestimated. Similarly, the team may be inclined to overlook the optimisation of existing processes and systems, as the focus tends to be on exploring new ways of working. To compensate for these potential blind spots, the team could benefit from adding members in the Relationship–Optimisation quadrant, who help consider the impact of actions on others and support the development of strong, sustainable relationships. In addition, more representation in the Content–Optimisation quadrant could contribute to improving existing processes and delivering high-quality outcomes.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team has a relatively strong foundation for successful collaboration across the full Business Performance Dialogue, with meaningful contributions in the first two phases and clear opportunities for growth in the third. The team is well-positioned to excel in the first phase, "Leading Change with People," with four team members naturally contributing in this area. This phase focuses on initiating change, inspiring others, and aligning stakeholders—internally and externally—around a shared vision. The team’s strength here suggests that it is skilled at engaging others, building momentum, and identifying opportunities for transformation. It likely excels at communicating ideas, generating buy-in, and energising people around new directions. The second phase, the "Operational Core," is also well covered, with three team members providing valuable contributions. This phase is about translating ideas into action: building the necessary structures, maintaining operational focus, and ensuring consistency in execution. The team's presence in this phase indicates an ability to move from vision to implementation—making things work in practice, not just in theory. These members help ensure that initiatives don't lose traction once the initial excitement fades. However, the third phase, "Structured Delivery," presents a potential area for improvement. This phase requires a focus on quality assurance, process reliability, and disciplined follow-through. It demands attention to detail, critical thinking, and a systems-level perspective—ensuring that what is delivered is not only complete and timely, but also scalable and repeatable. Currently, the team lacks natural contributors in this phase, which may lead to challenges in fully embedding solutions or maintaining long-term standards in delivery. To address this, the team could consider assigning specific roles and responsibilities to ensure that structured delivery is explicitly managed and not unintentionally deprioritised. Alternatively, or additionally, the team could bring in external expertise or collaborate with colleagues who are stronger in this domain—particularly when projects require high levels of structure, analytical depth, or scalable delivery models. Strengthening this phase will help the team close the loop between vision, execution, and long-term impact.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is well-positioned to excel in the first phase of the dialogue: Inventive Exploration. With three team members scoring in this phase, the team is well equipped to generate new ideas, explore opportunities, and challenge the status quo. This is a critical phase for innovation, and the team is clearly set up to thrive here. The second phase—Operational Testing—is also a strength, with three members contributing meaningfully. This indicates the team has a solid capacity to assess feasibility, test ideas in practice, and begin translating concepts into structured, executable steps. These members help ensure that ideas don’t remain abstract, but start to take shape in the real world. The third phase—Embedding with People—is the most vulnerable for this team. There are no natural contributors in this phase, though a few members are positioned near this area and may be able to stretch into it. This phase focuses on the long-term adoption and integration of innovations—ensuring ideas are not only implemented but accepted and embraced by the people who work with them. Without strong attention here, even well-developed ideas may struggle to take root across the organisation. To strengthen this phase, the team could encourage stretch from those nearby or bring in additional perspectives—internally or externally—that are more naturally inclined to focus on stakeholder impact, behavioural adoption, and sustainable embedding.


Project: VebaBox
Focus: Summary
Description: This team has a good balance between customer focus and product/technical focus, with a clustering toward the center of the AEM-Cube. There is a slight preference toward the relational side, complemented by several team members who bring a strong content focus, helping to create balance. As a result, the team is well-equipped to navigate between “what do we have to offer stakeholders” and “what do they really want?” However, there is a minor risk that the exploratory, people-focused cluster may dominate discussions. It helps when team members actively seek out and challenge each other’s perspectives. In terms of exploration, the team leans slightly toward exploring new ideas but is not highly innovative. Their strength lies in testing and optimizing existing processes, and they are likely reliable and timely in their delivery. To foster greater innovation, the team would benefit from creating more space for experimentation. There is a potential bridging challenge between the operational domain and the optimization cluster. The team appears to have fewer members capable of connecting these areas, which may hinder their ability to translate and align perspectives—particularly during projects or collaborations where maintaining cohesion is key. Overall, the team is versatile and adaptable to different situations. They are capable of both exploring new ideas and improving existing processes, and they are strong in both relationship-building and content expertise. This versatility is a strength, but it can also make prioritization difficult, as team members may value different angles. Clear agreements and direction are essential to keep everyone aligned. An important question is: who provides leadership within this team? And does ownership rotate based on the type of project and the result areas required to lead it successfully?

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team has a fairly wide range of Attachment scores, with a slight concentration in the middle. This suggests the team is relatively well balanced between customer focus and product/technical focus. Most team members fall into the mid-range, which indicates they are likely able to consider both perspectives and work together to align the product with customer needs. This is a team capable of having constructive, balanced conversations about this. To make the most of this diversity, it's important that team members actively bring in their different viewpoints during meetings. Those who are more strongly customer-focused or more technically/product-oriented—positioned closer to the extremes of the AEM-Cube—can offer valuable insights. A helpful question to reflect on is whether these perspectives are being fully used in group discussions, or if certain voices tend to dominate.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team shows a fairly balanced distribution of Exploration scores, with a slight concentration in the middle of the Growth curve and another cluster toward the optimization end. This suggests that the team is more oriented toward developing and enhancing existing ideas than radically innovating or disrupting the status quo. While not highly exploratory, the team is likely to excel at refining, improving, and reliably delivering on current concepts—demonstrating a hands-on, execution-focused mindset grounded in the present. As a result, the team is probably strong at delivering high-quality products and services on time and within budget. However, the absence of team members with very high Exploration scores, combined with the clustering toward refinement and optimization, may limit the team's ability to generate breakthrough ideas or respond quickly to market shifts. To strengthen its innovation capacity, the team could benefit from adding members with a higher exploratory mindset or by actively cultivating a culture that values experimentation, curiosity, and learning through iteration.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team demonstrates a strong capacity to tackle complex challenges, with a healthy diversity along the Managing Complexity dimension. A significant portion of its members contribute in a more generalist way, complemented by four team members who offer a more specialised contribution. This suggests the team is well-equipped to address complex problems effectively from multiple perspectives. One of the key conditions for dealing with complexity is precisely this kind of strategic diversity along the generalist–specialist axis. To fully leverage this strength, the team could consider steps such as assigning specific roles to those who have the skills to manage both specialist and generalist issues. Additionally, the team could enhance its performance by encouraging members to further develop their capabilities in this area through training and development opportunities. Finally, while diversity along this dimension is key in driving strategic performance, more diversity also requires even higher levels of trust and understanding than usual: it is imperative that the team members are aware of this and keep investing in their understanding, communication and cooperation.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team is almost perfectly balanced, with a slight inclination toward the Relationship–Exploration quadrant. This gives the team a certain speed and dynamism. Balance is a major strength, as it enables the team to perform well across all areas. The team is capable of exploring new ideas and opportunities while also focusing on optimizing existing processes and systems. It can also build and maintain strong relationships, both internally and with external stakeholders. However, this balance can also be a weakness, as the team may struggle with prioritization and decision-making. Differences in priorities and perspectives among team members can lead to conflict. To address this, the team could benefit from appointing a clear leader to help guide decisions and resolve conflicts. Additionally, developing a clear vision and strategy could help align the team’s efforts and priorities.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is well-balanced in terms of the Business Performance Dialogue. There are contributions across all three phases, with most team members contributing to the first phase of the dialogue – Changing with People. This means the team is capable of initiating new projects and initiatives while maintaining energy and momentum. The second phase is slightly underrepresented, which may indicate that the team occasionally struggles to stay focused on the operational aspects of the business. The third phase – Structured Delivery - is well represented, suggesting that the team can deliver results in a structured and reliable way. Overall, this is a team that performs well across all phases of the Business Performance Dialogue, though it could benefit from placing a bit more emphasis on the operational side of business processes.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is likely to encounter challenges in effectively navigating the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue due to an uneven distribution of contributions across its three critical phases. With only one team member contributing to the first phase, which focuses on idea generation and innovation, the team may lack the creative momentum needed to consistently generate new ideas or initiate forward-looking initiatives. In contrast, a large portion of the team is active in the second phase, indicating strong capabilities in testing, validating, and operationalizing concepts—suggesting that once ideas are introduced, the team is well-equipped to bring them into structured execution. However, the lack of team members in the third phase—which centers on embedding innovations sustainably and in alignment with people, culture, and long-term adoption—poses a significant risk. Without focused attention here, even well-developed ideas may fail to take root or deliver lasting impact. To address these gaps, the team could take several steps: assigning clearer roles based on the phases of the dialogue, encouraging members on the edges of the core distribution to stretch into underrepresented areas, and fostering a culture that values contributions across the full innovation lifecycle. Additionally, bringing in temporary support from individuals outside the team—particularly those with strengths in early-stage ideation or people-driven implementation—can help bridge these gaps. Strengthening contributions across all three phases will enable the team to move from inspiration to implementation, ensuring innovations are not only developed but also sustainably embedded within the organization.


Project: Self evaluation FMO
Focus: Summary
Description: This team has a near perfect spread along the Exploration dimension, indicating that this team is extremely well set-up to facilitate the entire Growth-Cycle. As long as people are allowed and encouraged to stay and contribute close to their strengths, the team will be able to generate new ideas, execute on them, and then refine and optimize them. There is no clear dominant group within this team, indicating that the team will very naturally balance these different focus areas. When it comes to the Attachment dimension as well, there is a good spread which indicates a very healthy product-client dialogue. There is a slight emphasis towards the content side, which good lead to the focus of the team to be slightly more on the product, process, technical and/or data-driven aspects of the team but the real focus is on bridging product and client: making sure clients are heard and understood and that the products and data are built to meet their wishes and demands. This often results in a balanced dialogue where there will equal amounts of attention and priority paid to the people side of the team and it’s work and the results it’s delivering. Finally, there is a nice balance between generalists and specialists, setting the team up to deal with complex challenges and situations effectively and successfully. All this allows for a diverse and agile team; it is important however that people know how to use this diversity in practice and that they keep working on communicating with each other and understanding each other.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team is slightly skewed towards the product side, with a healthy focus on the technical aspects of the product. This can be beneficial for ensuring that the product is well-developed and technically sound. The core focus of this team in the Product-Client dialogue lies around connecting the two and making sure there is balance. This creates for a flexible team that knows to pay attention to both sides of this dialogue but which is not really outspoken in either way. There is one more clear contribution to the relationship side, making sure that the team does not lost sight of the relationships with the relevant stakeholders, whether they be external (clients, partners and suppliers) or internal (the team members and their interactions). However, given the fact that there is only one outspoken relationship-focused contribution does create the risk that this voice may be drowned out. As a result, the team may struggle at times to prioritize customer feedback and may not be as responsive to market demands as a more customer-focused team, especially when it is put under stress. This could result in a product that is technically excellent but not optimally aligned with what customers are looking for. To improve, the team could benefit from incorporating more customer-focused perspectives, either by bringing in new team members with a stronger customer orientation or by encouraging existing team members to develop a deeper understanding of customer needs and preferences. Most importantly, however, is that the team is clearly aligned with its strategic objectives: if it needs to come up with technical solutions it could benefit from a bit more content-focus, if it needs to work more with customers it could use a slight emphasis towards the relationship side.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team is very well-balanced when it comes to exploration versus optimization. It has a few members who are very high on exploration and are likely to come up with new ideas and solutions, a few members who are very low on exploration and are likely to focus on optimizing existing processes and solutions, and a few members who are in the middle and can bridge the gap between the two. This is a very healthy distribution for a team that needs to balance innovation with efficiency, such as a product development team or a research and development team. The team is likely to be able to come up with new ideas and solutions while also being able to deliver them in a timely and efficient manner. However, in an environment like this it is especially important that people listen to each other and make an effort to understand each other. There will frequently be differences of opinion and of focus area: this can at times be difficult and frustrating but will also be a driving force behind the team’s excellent ability to perform and deliver.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team has a strong foundation for managing complexity, with a really good balance in contributions on the vertical dimension. It is this diversity which indicates a robust ability to handle complex challenges and make strategic decisions. However, it is important to notice that there is only one real bridging contribution between the more outspoken generalist and specialist contributions. It requires quality of interactions between the generalists and specialists that allow the team to deepen the strategic dialogue and operate as effectively as possible in dealing with complex situations and challenges: it could therefore help to have one or a few additional contributions in the middle of this dimension to help facilitate dialogue between specialists and generalists and make sure that there are enough more balanced contributions as well. Additionally, the team could benefit from having one more extremely specialized contribution to add even more diversity and offset the high amount of generalist contributions. Finally, the team needs to make sure that all voices are heard: by fostering an environment where all perspectives are valued and integrated, the team can ensure that it remains agile and responsive to unexpected and complex challenges.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team has a decent balance between the different quadrants. The Relationship-Exploration quadrant is most under-represented, which means that the team might not instinctively prioritize exploring and building relationships with new clients and other stakeholders. The Content-Optimization quadrant is well-represented, which means that the team will be able to focus on the quality of the content that it produces. The Content-Exploration quadrant is does have a few contributions, albeit not really outspoken. This means that while team will manage to come up with new ideas and initiatives, this can not be separated from the needs and wishes of the clients (it might prove challenging to just think outside the box the sake of it). The Relationship-Optimization quadrant is represented in this team, which means that the team will be able to build out and maintain long-term relationships with clients and other stakeholders. However, given the fact that this is only one outspoken contribution, the team will need to make sure it is given enough priority when necessary. Overall, this team is well-balanced and should be able to perform well in most situations. However, it may benefit from bringing in more people who score higher in the Content-Exploration and Relationship-Exploration quadrants to help it come up with radical new ideas and explore new clients and other people-based opportunities.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team might find the first phase of this dialogue challenging, which is focused on exploration and people. This phase is characterized by a lot of energy, enthusiasm, and a willingness to take risks when it comes to sales, culture and other people-based initiatives. The team has people who can stretch to this phase but nobody who is naturally clearly naturally contributing here. However, the team is strong in the second phase, which is focused on operational excellence. This phase is characterized by a focus on efficiency, execution, and getting things done. The team has several members who are very strong in this phase, which means that the team is likely to be very good at executing on ideas and delivering results. The team is also strong in the third phase, which is focused on structure and organization. This phase is characterized by a focus on planning, process, and ensuring that everything is done in a systematic and orderly way. The team has several members who are very strong in this phase, which means that the team is likely to be very good at creating and maintaining structure and order. Overall, this team is very well-balanced across the second and third phases of the group dynamic, but may struggle in the first phase. This means that the team is likely to be very good at executing projects and delivering results, but may struggle a little finding new clients, launching new client initiatives, exploring new partnerships etc.: the team can absolutely do this but it will require a few people to stretch in order to deliver the best results.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is decently equipped to handle the first phase of this dialogue, with a significant portion of its members contributing in the vicinity of this area. It will require them to stretch a little but that can absolutely be done if encouraged and enabled. This phase is crucial for generating new technical ideas and fostering product inventions. The team also has a few members in the middle phase of this dialogue, which is beneficial for bridging the gap between idea generation and delivery to clients. These members can help translate innovative ideas into practical solutions and ensure that the team's explorations are aligned with the client wishes and needs. The team could use one or two more contributions in the last phase; having only natural contribution could slightly hinder its ability to sustain and nurture client relationships, both internally and externally. This gap might affect the team's cohesion and its ability to maintain long-term partnerships or customer relationships. Additionally, adding one person with an outspoken contribution in the first phase (exploratory and content-focused) might alleviate the people near that phase so that they don’t need to stretch themselves, something they will absolutely be able to do but which will require some energy and additional attention.


Project: DEI Committee Insight Investment
Focus: Summary
Description: This is quite a cognitively diverse team. It has a near perfect balance along the Attachment  dimension with five contributions towards the relationship side and four contributions on the content side. Additionally, the contributions range from the more extreme, outspoken ends of the dimension towards the middle, indicating that this team is capable of discussing both the more extreme points and bridging their opinions and viewpoints. This diversity indicates that this team is capable of a very effective product-client dialogue with perhaps a slight emphasis on the people side of things. When it comes to the Exploration dimension, there is pretty strong skewness visible towards the optimization side (the later phases of the Growth-Curve). Two people naturally contribute very exploratory but the main focus on this team’s dialogue and cooperation will be focused on improving, optimizing and monitoring existing processes and projects. This team is definitely capable of generating new ideas, thinking out of the box and launching new initiatives but it is imperative that the exploratory people are heard and that everyone involved is willing to stretch themselves into the gap that now exists in order to avoid failures and suboptimal results around execution. Finally, there is very nice spread along the vertical dimension, indicating that this team is very well equipped to deal with complex challenges. There is a very nice balance between specialist, generalist and more moderate contributions along this dimension: as long as everyone is heard and people are capable of contributing to the dialogue, this team will be able to have very deep, meaningful and effective strategic discussions.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team has a fairly balanced distribution of Attachment scores, with a slight tendency towards the people side. This balance suggests that the team is well-positioned to bridge the gap between product and customer needs. The presence of both higher (people-focused) and lower scores (content-focused) indicates that the team can effectively manage both perspectives, which is crucial for achieving market fit and customer engagement. The team is likely to be able to understand and respond to customer needs while also maintaining a strong focus on the product and its technical aspects. However, the lack of extremely high scores could indicate a potential gap in truly understanding and prioritizing the customer perspective, which could lead to small blind spots in customer engagement and responsiveness. Overall, this team is well-equipped to achieve alignment between product and customer needs, but could benefit from further strengthening its customer focus.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description:  This team has a reasonable distribution of Exploration scores, with quite a strong skew towards the Optimization side. This spread could potentially create a fertile ground for a productive dialogue between exploration and optimization, which is crucial for successful innovation. However, given the fact that there are only contributions on the exploration side and there is a big gap between them and theother contributions, this team might run into exploration and execution challenges, potentially performing sub-optimally when it comes to generating new ideas to delivering them in a timely manner. The skew towards optimization could result in a slight preferencefor efficiency and practicality over exploration and experimentation. To ensure that the team continues to generate new ideas and explore new possibilities, it is imperative that the members with the highest Exploration scores are heard and that everyone makes it a priority to stretch themselves towards the middle so as to most effectively move from ideas to results.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index
Description:  This team demonstrates a well-balanced distribution of managing complexity scores, with members spanning across all quadrants. This diversity in scores suggests that the team is well equipped to handle a variety of complex challenges. The presence of members with lower scores indicates a comfort in and preference for managing more complicated and expertise-driven tasks that require deep-rooted knowledge, skills and experience, while those with higher scores are likely to excel in dealing with broader, more complex, strategy- and/or process focused issues. The middle scores provide a valuable bridge between these two extremes, facilitating effective communication and collaboration within the team. Overall, this balance of scores suggests that the team is capable of effectively managing complex challenges, making it a highly versatile and adaptable group. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that this high diversity does require the group to be acutely aware of each other's contributions and how to use them optimally and it requires people to continuously listen to each other in order to truly trust and understand each other. If the group is able to do this, it has a very powerful basis for managing complex challenges and navigating complex situations.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description:  This team has a strong focus on relationships and optimization, with 5 of its members in the Relationship-Optimization quadrant.This suggests a team that is highly attuned to the needs of others and skilled at building out and maintaining relationships. The team also has a smaller but still significant focus on content, with 4 of its members scoring on the content-side, of which 2 in the Content-Optimization quadrant. This suggests a team that is capable of producing high-quality work and delivering results. The team has a smaller focus on exploration, with only 2 of its members on the exploration side, both in the Content-Exploration quadrant. This suggests a team that may be less inclined to take risks or pursue new opportunities. However, this could also be seen as a strength, as it suggests a team that is more likely to be stable and reliable. The team has no members in the Relationship-Exploration quadrant, which could be a potential blind spot. This suggests a team that may be less inclined to explore new ways of finding and building new (client) relationships or to take risks in this area. However, given the team's strong focus on relationships and optimization, this may not be a significant issue. Overall, this team is well-balanced and has the potential to perform well in a variety of situations. It is likely to be particularly effective in roles that require a focus on relationships and delivering people-oriented results, such as customer service or account management.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: Along the Business Performance Dialogue, this team is not very well-balanced. There is nobody naturally contributing in the first phase: people focused exploration. The two members naturally contributing to this dialogue are both in the last two phase: the Operational and Content-Optimization phases. This indicates that this team will struggle to focus on this dialogue, let alone put it into practice. It will not be the first inclination nor the first priority of this team to seek commercial opportunities and to launch new people-focused initiatives. When these ideas are generated, the two people that are contributing to this dialogue will be able to pick them up, operationalize them and optimize them. This dialogue will therefor mostly focus on the structuring and optimizing aspects of the process of landing new opportunities, building them out and refining them. This team could benefit from a couple more People-Exploration focused contributions to help create a more balanced and effective dialogue around driving business performance.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description:  This team is well-positioned to contribute to the third phase of Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue, which focuses on sustaining and optimizing existing processes, products and initiatives with people (both clients and other stakeholders). This phase is crucial for embedding innovations in the organization and ensuring that they are accepted and embraced by others. The team has two contributions in the first phase of the dialogue, which is essential for initiating new ideas and projects. These contributions are critical to the earlier stages of the innovation process, such as research and experimentation. However, since there are only two voices in this phase against five in the third phase, this hard content-focused exploration might not always get the focus and priority it requires. To address this, the team could consider assigning roles to existing members that encourage them to stretch into this phase, or bringing in new members who naturally contribute to this phase. The team is also somewhat underrepresented in the second phase of the dialogue, which is important foroperationalizing ideas and making them practical. This could be addressed by making sure everyone is aware of this potential challenge and putting in energy to stretch themselves into this phase. Overall, the team is well-equipped to help the organization move from ideas to practical, sustainable innovations, but could benefit from slightly more diversity in the earlier phases of the dialogue to strengthen the process of going from exploration to 
operationalization.


Project: chris zomerdijk idds
Focus: Summary
Description: This team shows a strong distribution across the entire AEM-Cube, and is therefore likely to be flexible in changing situations and capable of successfully handling complex challenges. Despite this wide diversity, there is a clearly dominant presence in the Content-Optimization quadrant, which likely results in a results-driven and task-oriented culture. Team members in this quadrant focus strongly on achieving concrete goals, meeting deadlines, and delivering high-quality outcomes. They tend to prefer structured working methods, thorough execution, and analytical thinking. As a result, the team is likely to be highly reliable, efficient, and meticulous in honoring commitments and achieving project objectives. These qualities make the team particularly well-suited for environments where stability, accuracy, and continuity are essential. The team is also well represented in the Exploration domain, though to a lesser extent than on the optimization side. As a result, the team as a whole may be less inclined to take risks, think outside the box, or actively seek new opportunities—both in terms of content and collaboration. Additionally, there is relatively less representation in the Relationship-Optimization quadrant, which may suggest that when the team is under pressure or facing tight deadlines, collaboration, communication, and personal attention—both internally and with external stakeholders—may receive less priority. Finally, there is a strong balance in contributions along the vertical axis, which provides a solid foundation for deep and sharp strategic dialogue. Specialists are encouraged to share their expertise and experience, while generalists can help create the broader context in which specialists can thrive. Overall, this kind of diversity forms the basis for a highly flexible and powerful team—particularly in dealing with strategic challenges and execution. However, the key to unlocking this potential lies in mutual trust, understanding, and continuous active listening—especially when the team is under pressure.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team shows a slight tendency toward product and technical aspects, with more than half of the members scoring in the lower two quartiles on Attachment. This suggests a focus on internal development and technical excellence over direct customer interaction. At the same time, there is also a significant group with medium to high scores, indicating a solid understanding of customer needs and a desire to respond to them. This diversity in Attachment scores suggests that the team is capable of combining product development with customer orientation. However, there is only one contribution located squarely in the middle of this dimension, which may cause communication between content-focused and relationship-focused individuals to be challenging at times. To strengthen this, the team could benefit from one or two additional contributions in the middle range and from a continued investment by all members in collaborating and communicating effectively—especially with those on the opposite end of the Attachment axis.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team leans toward the optimization side of the AEM-Cube, with half of the members scoring below 25 on the Exploration axis. This indicates a strong focus on efficiency, process improvement, and delivering practical solutions. These members are likely to prioritize timely execution, meeting deadlines, and maintaining a sense of realism. There are fewer individuals with high Exploration scores, suggesting that the team may struggle with generating new ideas, thinking creatively, or exploring innovative opportunities. The absence of true explorers means the team may be less inclined to challenge the status quo or push boundaries. Some members score in the mid-range, which can help bridge the gap between exploration and optimization. However, this may not always be enough to counterbalance the strong optimization tendency. If exploration is a strategic priority, the team would benefit from bringing in new members with high Exploration scores or encouraging current members to challenge one another and continue displaying exploratory behaviors.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team is well balanced in terms of managing complexity, with most members falling within the mid-range. This suggests the team is capable of handling complex situations effectively. Based on their distribution on the foundational axis, they are likely to approach problems in a structured and logical way, making decisions grounded in thorough analysis of the available information. This balance enables them to recognize and address risks and challenges in a timely manner. While they may tend to rely on established frameworks and processes, their balance on the vertical axis equips them to navigate complex or ambiguous situations successfully. The high diversity in this area provides a strong foundation for deep strategic dialogue—but it’s important that each team member remains aware of their optimal contribution. Specialists will add great value by bringing deep expertise and challenging the conversation in original ways, while generalists will naturally take a broader, more strategic perspective, helping to create the context and framework in which specialists can thrive. Ultimately, it is crucial that all team members continue to invest in trusting and understanding one another to fully leverage this cognitive diversity.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team shows a clear preference for the Content-Optimization quadrant, with more than half of the members positioned here. This indicates an analytical and detail-oriented team focused on process improvement, efficiency, and delivering high-quality results. While this strength is highly valuable for thoroughness and accuracy, it also carries the risk of overemphasizing details at the expense of broader perspective or developing resistance to change. The Relationship-Optimization quadrant is also reasonably represented, suggesting that the team is not only result-driven but also mindful of relationships. This balance adds value by combining task focus with people focus. However, the Relationship-Exploration and Content-Exploration quadrants are underrepresented, which may indicate a limited capacity for innovation or idea generation. This could lead to stagnation, as the team may be less inclined to take risks or seize new opportunities. Encouraging more exploratory thinking or adding members who naturally operate in these quadrants could help address this gap. Finally, the team lacks representation in the Operational Core, which suggests a potential absence of a central anchor to balance differing priorities and perspectives and ensure cohesive operational execution. This could result in misalignment or misunderstandings—especially around prioritization or decision-making. Appointing a leader or facilitator who can bridge perspectives and align the team around shared goals could help mitigate this risk.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team shows a clear imbalance in contributions across the three phases of the Business Performance Dialogue. Only two team members contribute—albeit peripherally—to Phase 1: Changing with People, which centers on innovation, customer engagement, and long-term vision. This limited representation suggests the team may struggle to initiate change, explore new opportunities, or maintain a strong external and customer-oriented focus. In Phase 2: Operational Core, just one team member is active, indicating limited capacity for day-to-day operations, coordination, and communication between the exploratory and delivery-focused ends of the dialogue. This gap could result in misalignment and inefficiencies. The majority of team members contribute to Phase 3: Structured Delivery, which emphasizes results, quality, and systems. This is where the team’s strength lies—they are likely reliable and effective in delivering outcomes. However, this strong emphasis on execution may also create a risk-averse mindset, with less focus on innovation and evolving customer needs. To create a more balanced team, it would be valuable to bring in individuals who naturally contribute to the first two phases—or support existing team members in stretching toward those areas. This would help the team move more fluidly between exploration, execution, and delivery.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: Within the three phases of the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue, this team shows a clear imbalance. Two team members are positioned near the Inventive Exploration phase, which focuses on idea generation, research, and experimentation. This suggests a potential lack of natural exploration—and by extension, innovation—within the team. Only one member is active in the Operational Testing phase, indicating limited capacity to practically test and refine ideas. This phase requires structured and analytical thinking to bridge the gap between inspiration and implementation. Similarly, just one team member contributes to the Sustaining with People phase, which is critical for embedding change, building relationships, and maintaining alignment with customer needs over time. To address these gaps, the team could consider bringing in individuals who naturally operate in the first two phases or encouraging current team members to develop their capabilities in these areas. This would help ensure that ideas are not only generated, but also effectively tested, implemented, and sustainably anchored within the organization.


Project: allsafe combi 16 april
Focus: Summary
Description: This is a team that is strongly clustered in the content–exploration corner, with a slight focus on operationalization and a few outliers leaning toward relationship and optimization. Most of the Attachment scores fall in the middle range, with an emphasis on the content side. This suggests a team that is primarily task- and results-oriented, with collaboration and communication likely to be rational and fact-driven. It's important that customers—both external and internal—are not overlooked in this dynamic. The single strong relationship-focused contributor can play an important role here but must be given space to be heard. The team demonstrates a strong foundation for innovation and execution. The high Exploration scores reflect a forward-thinking, risk-taking mindset—an important driver of renewal. These team members are likely effective at generating innovative ideas, exploring possibilities, and pushing boundaries. Those with mid-range scores bridge the gap between exploration and optimization and help turn ideas into action. Lower Exploration scores (more optimization-focused contributions) are heavily outnumbered; while they help ground the team with a focus on feasibility and results, they may often be overlooked or unheard in this team. Finally, the team is well distributed along the Managing Complexity dimension, indicating strong capability in handling complex situations, making decisions under uncertainty, and managing multiple priorities. The lower scores on this dimension bring valuable contributions in terms of detail, expertise, and execution, while the higher scores tend to focus more naturally on the broader context, the full process, and on connecting and integrating people and ideas.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team is strongly clustered in the middle of the Attachment dimension, with a tendency toward the content side. This indicates a team that is moderately focused on customer needs and market demand, while likely directing most of its attention to products, data, internal processes, and technical aspects. The majority of team members fall within the mid-range, suggesting that the team is generally able to balance customer needs with internal priorities. However, there are relatively few members with very high or very low Attachment scores, which may limit the team’s capacity to fully understand customer needs or to drive internal improvements with strength and focus. Amplifying the voices of members with high Attachment scores—those more attuned to customers—and those with low scores—who offer valuable insights into internal processes and technical challenges—can help enhance both customer focus and product or process specialization.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team shows a strong focus on exploration and the early stages of operationalization. Just under half of the team scores in the mid-range and about a third scores high, indicating a strong capacity to generate innovative ideas, pursue new opportunities, and effectively put them into action. This is a team that enjoys thinking outside the box and turning new ideas into tangible results. However, the relatively small number of members with low scores—who typically contribute to efficiency, feasibility, and optimization—poses a risk: their perspectives may easily be overlooked. To mitigate this, the team should consciously integrate their input into decision-making, ensuring that innovation is balanced with practicality and execution.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: The team is well distributed across the Managing Complexity dimension, with a slight skew toward the higher end. Five members score high and draw energy from overseeing and making sense of complex situations and high-level strategic issues. They naturally see the bigger picture, approach challenges from multiple perspectives, and tend to seek input and dialogue with others. Six members fall into the mid-range and play a key role in bridging the extremes along this dimension. They are comfortable handling both complex and more straightforward tasks. Three members score lower on the scale, leaning more toward specialist thinking. They likely gain energy from solving problems that require depth and expertise, contributing through their focus on detail and execution. This broad distribution is a strength, equipping the team to handle a wide range of challenges. At the same time, this diversity of perspectives can also create friction due to differing approaches and mindsets. It is therefore especially important that all voices are heard and valued—particularly when making decisions.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: The team is predominantly oriented toward the Content-Exploration quadrant, with more than half of its members positioned there. This reflects a strong focus on technical innovation, experimentation, and pushing boundaries in terms of content and ideas. The team is likely dynamic and forward-looking, constantly seeking new opportunities and ways to improve. However, the complete absence of members in the Relationship-Optimization quadrant may represent a blind spot. This area is essential for maintaining and strengthening long-term relationships, both internally and externally. Without representation here, the team may struggle with long-term relationship management, potentially impacting client retention and internal cohesion. There are a few members in the Relationship-Exploration quadrant, which supports the building of new networks and connections, but this may not fully compensate for the lack of focus on sustaining relationships. Similarly, the Content-Optimization quadrant is underrepresented, which could mean missed opportunities for refinement, quality control, and process improvement—potentially leading to inefficiencies or lack of attention to detail. Lastly, the absence of members in the central Operational Core suggests a potential gap in attention to day-to-day operations, structure, and execution. This may hinder the team's ability to implement and follow through on initiatives and manage practical tasks effectively. In summary, while the team excels in innovation and content-driven exploration, it would benefit from greater balance across the remaining quadrants to ensure long-term success, operational efficiency, and relational stability.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is well-positioned in the first two phases of the Business Performance Dialogue. A majority of team members contribute naturally to Phase 1: Changing with People, which focuses on innovation, new opportunities, and engaging customers and stakeholders. This strong representation creates a fertile environment for idea generation and forward-looking thinking. Phase 2: Operational Core is also well covered, indicating solid capability in planning, organizing, and executing activities to move ideas into action. However, Phase 3: Structured Delivery—which centers on ensuring quality, consistency, and long-term implementation—is underrepresented, with only two team members contributing naturally here. This may result in a lack of focus on embedding solutions, maintaining efficient operations, and delivering reliable outcomes over time. If delivering sustained results is a strategic priority, the team could benefit from assigning clearer responsibilities in this phase or encouraging current members to stretch into it. Alternatively, bringing in individuals who naturally operate in this space could help ensure that strong ideas and well-executed plans are also reliably delivered and maintained.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team has a strong cluster of members positioned at the intersection of the Inventive Exploration and Operational Testing phases. This indicates a natural strength in generating innovative ideas and beginning to translate them into practical applications. With only a modest stretch, the team is well equipped to cover the early stages of the innovation process—developing, experimenting with, and beginning to structure new concepts. However, there is a significant gap in the final phase, Sustaining with People. No team members are naturally positioned here, which could pose a challenge when it comes to embedding innovations into the organization, ensuring adoption, and maintaining long-term commitment from internal and external stakeholders. To address this, the team could consider assigning roles that specifically focus on embedding and sustaining outcomes, or seek collaboration with individuals outside the team who naturally operate in this phase. Doing so will help ensure that promising ideas are not only developed and tested, but also carried forward and anchored in practice.


Project: eo board
Focus: Summary
Description: This team demonstrates a well-balanced distribution across the Attachment, Exploration, and Managing Complexity dimensions. In the Attachment dimension, the team is slightly more skewed towards the higher end, indicating a slight preference for the relationship side. This suggests that the team is likely to be people-oriented and focused on building and maintaining relationships, both within the team and with external stakeholders. This can be a strength in situations that require collaboration and communication, but may also lead to challenges when it comes to making difficult decisions or prioritizing tasks. In the Exploration dimension, the team is evenly distributed, with a slight bias towards the operation to exploration side of the AEM-Cube. This suggests that the team is capable of both exploring new ideas and opportunities, as well as operationalizing them into practical next steps. This balance can be a strength when it comes to innovation and problem-solving, as the team is likely to be able to generate new ideas and solutions, while also being able to assess their feasibility and practical implications. Finally, in the Managing Complexity dimension, the team is skewed towards the higher end, indicating a preference for generalist contributions. This suggests that the team is likely to be able to think in a more abstract and strategic way, and to see the bigger picture when it comes to complex problems and challenges. This can be a strength, but may also lead to challenges when it comes to getting into the details and delivering concrete results. Overall, this team is well-equipped to handle a wide range of situations and challenges, The team can benefit from paying more attention to the content side of the Attachment dimension and the specialist contributions in the Managing Complexity dimension, in order to ensure that it is able to make difficult decisions and deliver concrete results when necessary.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team shows a diverse range of Attachment scores, with a slight skew towards a higher attachment to customers and their needs. The majority of team members are either highly customer-focused or moderately so, which suggests that the team is likely to prioritize customer relationships, feedback, and satisfaction in its decision-making and operations. This customer-centric mindset can be a significant strength, as it helps the team align its products and services with market needs and build strong customer relationships. However, there are also a few team members with lower Attachment scores, indicating a more product-focused perspective. These individuals may be more inclined to think about the technical aspects of the team's offerings and ensure that the product vision is not compromised by external demands. While this perspective can provide valuable balance, the fact that these voices are outnumbered in the team could lead to their views being overshadowed by the more dominant customer-focused mindset. To ensure that both perspectives are heard and integrated into decision-making, the team could benefit from actively fostering open dialogue and encouraging all members to contribute their views. Additionally, the team might consider whether it needs to strengthen the product-focused perspective by involving these members more in relevant discussions or even bringing in additional people who can provide this viewpoint.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team shows a diverse but slightly imbalanced distribution of Exploration scores. The majority of members fall in the high to moderate exploration range, indicating a strong capacity for innovation, creativity, and a willingness to pursue new ideas. These members are likely to drive forward thinking and generate fresh approaches. A portion of the team sits in the moderate range, helping to bridge the gap between exploration and optimization—bringing a balance of innovation and pragmatism that supports both idea generation and practical application. Only a small number of team members score clearly on the optimization side, contributing a focus on execution, efficiency, and timely delivery. Their perspective is crucial for ensuring that innovative ideas are translated into workable, results-driven outcomes. This blend suggests that the team is well-positioned to handle both innovation and implementation, though the stronger lean toward exploration may at times result in an overemphasis on ideation at the expense of follow-through. To maintain balance, it’s important that the voices focused on practicality and execution are actively included in planning and decision-making, helping to ensure that creative ideas are both viable and deliverable.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team shows a broad and valuable distribution in Managing Complexity, positioning it well to handle a range of complex challenges. Nearly half of the team scores in the highest quartile, indicating a strong generalist orientation. These individuals tend to view challenges from a systemic, team-based perspective, and are likely to excel at connecting ideas, facilitating collaboration, and supporting the overall process. Their presence contributes to a culture of integration, reflection, and relationship-building. Another portion of the team falls within the moderate range, helping to bridge different perspectives and adding balance between system-wide thinking and individual contribution. This further strengthens the team’s ability to navigate complexity thoughtfully and collaboratively. However, the team is less represented by true specialists—those in the lowest quartile—who bring depth, precision, and highly focused expertise. These individuals tend to contribute through their personal mastery, technical insight, and drive for excellence. While fewer in number, their input is vital when challenges require rigor, deep analysis, or domain-specific solutions. The current skew toward generalist thinking creates a risk of overemphasizing discussion, abstraction, and connection—potentially at the expense of clarity, decisive action, or technical depth. To maintain a well-rounded approach, it’s important that the team actively listens to and integrates the voices of its specialist members. Doing so will help ensure that innovative thinking is matched with focused expertise and executional depth, enabling the team to deliver results that are both well-aligned and high quality. By balancing big-picture thinking with deep, individual contribution, the team can strengthen its ability to solve both complex and complicated challenges with greater effectiveness.

Description: This team demonstrates a well-rounded distribution across the different quadrants, indicating a balanced approach to various tasks and challenges. The strong representation in the Relationship–Exploration quadrant suggests that the team is highly capable of building and nurturing relationships, especially with clients, partners, and team members. Team members in this quadrant are likely to be proactive in seeking new opportunities and are enthusiastic about exploring new ideas and possibilities. The presence of individuals in the Content–Exploration quadrant indicates that the team is also well-equipped to generate innovative solutions. These team members are likely to be analytical and enjoy delving into the details of projects and tasks. The fewer individuals in the Relationship–Optimization quadrant may suggest that there is less focus on maintaining and strengthening existing relationships. This is a potential area for improvement, as these team members are typically skilled at ensuring customer satisfaction and fostering long-term partnerships. Finally, the presence of individuals in the Content–Optimization quadrant suggests that the team is also capable of delivering high-quality results and ensuring that projects are completed to a high standard. These team members are likely to be detail-oriented and focused on achieving results. 

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team shows a strong and well-rounded distribution across the Business Performance Dialogue, with particularly solid representation in the first two phases. With several members contributing to Phase 1: People and Change, the team is well-equipped to drive inspiration, innovation, and engagement, helping to initiate and energize new directions. The team is particularly strong in Phase 2: the Operational Core, where many members naturally contribute. These individuals help ensure that plans are translated into clear timelines, expectations are managed, and progress is consistently monitored—a vital foundation for dependable execution. Phase 3: Structured Delivery is represented by two team members who bring a focus on customer needs, long-term relationships, and sustained performance. While this phase is less populated, it is not absent, and these contributors provide important continuity at the end of the dialogue. To ensure that innovation leads to lasting impact, it will be important to create space for the voices in the third phase to be heard and supported, allowing them to do what they do best—embed outcomes into the customer context and ensure long-term delivery. Overall, this team is well-positioned to manage the full Business Performance Dialogue, with a particular strength in the operational and early-phase work, and a clear opportunity to further amplify its impact by elevating the structured delivery perspective.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team shows an uneven distribution across the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue. Its strength lies in Phase 2: Operational Testing, while it has limited representation in both Phase 1: Inventive Exploration and Phase 3: Sustaining with People. In Phase 2 – Operational Testing, several members contribute naturally, giving the team strong capabilities in translating ideas into practical solutions, applying structure, and testing innovations effectively. This makes it well-equipped to manage the middle part of the innovation process. However, the team lacks contributors in Phase 1 – Inventive Exploration, which is critical for generating new ideas, experimenting, and initiating innovation. Similarly, there is little presence in Phase 3 – Sustaining with People, which focuses on embedding innovation into the organization, fostering buy-in, and ensuring long-term impact. To strengthen its effectiveness across the full innovation cycle, the team could encourage members to stretch into the earlier and later phases or bring in complementary perspectives. This would help ensure that innovation is not only tested and structured, but also sparked from within and sustained over time.


Project: eo slt
Focus: Summary
Description: This team shows a reasonably balanced profile across the Attachment dimension, with a slight clustering in the lower mid half range. This indicates a healthy mix of task- and relationship-oriented input with a focus on connecting the content (the data, ideas, products, processes, etc.) with the relevant stakeholders (clients, employees, etc.). A few high scores indicate that customers are definitely not overlooked, though most members appear slightly more inward-looking. However, the overall balance suggests this is not a significant concern. On the Exploration dimension, the team is again relatively balanced, with a concentration of team members in the middle-range. This blend enables both innovation and execution, supporting idea generation as well as follow-through. Due to the concentration in the middle-range there might be a slight risk of establishing an ad-hoc culture, overly focused on operational activities but the distribution overall points to productive innovation. The Managing Complexity scores are also well distributed. This suggests the team is capable of navigating complex challenges and integrating diverse perspectives. The specialist contributions naturally support problem-solving, while higher scores help maintain a broader view; the combination of both provides the basis for the efficient managing of complex challenges. One or two additional strong specialists could help deepen the strategic discussion even further, though this does not seem extremely urgent given the distribution. Overall, the team is well-balanced and equipped to handle a range of challenges, from ideation to implementation. Encouraging more members to operate at the extremes of each dimension could further stretch thinking, support more radical innovation and drive the performance of the team even more.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team exhibits a diverse range of Attachment scores, with a concentration in the middle range. This suggests that the team is generally well-positioned to balance customer awareness with internal product and technical priorities. They are likely capable of engaging with customer perspectives while maintaining focus on delivery and development — a valuable position for ensuring market fit and operational efficiency. However, this central concentration may also lead to an overemphasis on operational compromise, where the team leans toward what's manageable or achievable rather than pushing fully toward either customer responsiveness or product rigor. Without active input from those at the higher and lower ends of the spectrum, important perspectives can be overlooked. Encouraging the voices of those with higher Attachment scores could help the team stay closely aligned with customer needs and external dynamics. Meanwhile, those with lower Attachment scores bring a critical lens that helps maintain technical integrity and challenge customer-driven assumptions when necessary. Both ends of the spectrum are essential to avoid drifting toward the middle by default and to ensure that decisions are both grounded and strategically focused.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team has a fairly wide distribution across the different score ranges on the Exploration dimension, with a slight concentration in the middle. This suggests a team that is well-balanced but slightly more focused on operational excellence. The higher-scoring members are likely to be more focused on innovation, and generating new ideas, while the lower-scoring members will be more focused on execution, efficiency, and practicality. The middle-scoring members will help bridge the gap between these two perspectives and ensure that the team is able to translate ideas into action. Overall, this team is likely to be capable of both generating new ideas and delivering solutions efficiently, but it may occasionally focus too much on operational, day to day activities which could sometimes get in the way of long-term strategic thinking. To ensure optimal performance, the team should be mindful of maintaining a balance between these two perspectives and make sure that the voices of all members are heard and valued.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team shows a relatively well-balanced distribution in its ability to manage complexity, with members spread across the spectrum and many falling in the medium to high range. This suggests the team is well-equipped to navigate complex challenges, particularly those requiring strategic thinking, coordination across functions, and the ability to consider multiple viewpoints.
There are several members who lean toward more specialist contributions, bringing focus, depth, and a practical lens to the team’s work. However, no one falls into the lowest quartile, meaning the team lacks true specialists — those who operate with deep, narrow, and highly technical expertise.
While the team’s generalist and mid-spectrum strengths allow it to align well around what needs to be done, the absence of true specialist input may limit its ability to fully understand or solve highly complicated problems — those that demand domain-specific depth, precision, and technical clarity.
To enhance its capability, the team could benefit from:
Incorporating more focused specialist perspectives, either through collaboration or future composition, and
Ensuring existing specialist-leaning voices are actively supported and integrated, particularly in situations that call for deep expertise.
By building on its strong base while strengthening its access to specialist thinking, the team can deepen its ability to solve complex and complicated challenges with both breadth and precision.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team is strongly focused on the Content–Optimization quadrant, with half of its members contributing here. This brings a clear strength: the team is likely to deliver high-quality work with strong attention to detail and precision. However, this also means that other areas are less well represented. Only one team member contributes to each of the Relationship-oriented quadrants, which may lead to less focus on building new relationships or maintaining long-term partnerships—both inside and outside the team. As a result, important interpersonal dynamics may be overlooked, potentially affecting collaboration and client relationships over time. There is moderate representation in the Content–Exploration quadrant, which supports the team’s ability to generate new ideas and solve problems creatively. A few members are also positioned in the Operational Core, helping to coordinate between different working styles and keep things moving effectively. Overall, the team is well-positioned to deliver strong results, when it comes to content and execution. To round out its capabilities, the team would benefit from strengthening its relationship-building and exploratory skills. This could be done by: Encouraging current team members to stretch into these areas, or bringing in new people who naturally contribute with a more relational or innovative perspective. This would help the team become more balanced, improving not only what it delivers but also how it connects and collaborates to achieve long-term success.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: Overall, this team covers the Business Performance Dialogue reasonably well, with particular strength in the later phases, though the early phase is less represented. The team has a strong presence in Phase 2: the Operational Core, with three members contributing here. Their positioning leans toward the later end of that phase, closer to Phase 3: Structured Delivery, where one additional team member is located. This gives the team a solid foundation for execution, structure, and delivering results. Phase 1: People and Change is underrepresented, with only one member contributing directly. As a result, the early part of the dialogue — focused on initiating change, generating ideas, and engaging others — may receive less attention. While the team is well equipped to manage operations and delivery, it would benefit from strengthening its presence in the earlier phase. With conscious effort — for example, by encouraging stretch from adjacent members or creating more space for early-stage dialogue — this gap can be addressed, enabling the team to engage more fully across the entire Business Performance Dialogue.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team shows a significant imbalance across the three phases of the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue: Inventive Exploration, Operational Testing, and Sustaining with People. The team has no natural contributors in either the first or third phase, and is concentrated in the second phase, with around three members contributing to Operational Testing. This means the team is well-positioned to test and refine ideas, translating concepts into structured, workable solutions. However, the absence of contributors in Inventive Exploration may limit the team’s ability to generate original ideas or explore new opportunities. Likewise, the lack of representation in Sustaining with People suggests challenges in embedding solutions into the organization and engaging stakeholders for long-term adoption. One team member is positioned near the Inventive Exploration phase and could potentially stretch into this space to help initiate idea generation and exploration. To address these gaps, the team could consider several strategies: Encourage stretch contributions from members adjacent to the underrepresented phases — particularly those near Inventive Exploration or with people-oriented strengths that could support Sustaining with People. Assign rotating roles that focus on ideation and stakeholder engagement to distribute responsibility and build awareness across the team. Bring in external perspectives or collaborators who naturally contribute in the missing areas to support specific innovation efforts. By deliberately addressing these blind spots, the team can move closer to covering the full Safeguarding Innovation dialogue — from idea generation, through testing, to long-term adoption and impact.


Project: eo new board
Focus: Summary
Description: This team shows a clear preference for working with people, exploring new relationships, and establishing connections both within the team and with clients and other stakeholders. This strength in relationship management makes the team well-equipped for roles involving sales, account management, change initiatives, etc. The team skews very heavily towards exploration with some small attention on operational implementation, indicating a team that is actively looking for new ideas, eager to innovate, and willing to take risks. This combination of exploration and people-attachment suggests a team that can generate new ideas and initiatives while keeping the needs and perspectives of others in mind. The team is likely able to move from idea generation to practical implementation reasonably well, making it well-suited to dynamic, fast-paced environments where both creativity and collaboration are key. However, the team may benefit from paying attention to optimisation and implementation, ensuring that ideas are not only generated but also effectively translated into structured plans and actions. Finally, the team skews heavily towards high generalized contributions, indicating a focus on handling multiple perspectives, balancing different priorities and taking a holistic and integrative approach towards strategic discussions. However, the lack of specialized contributions decreases the team’s ability to manage the varying aspects of complex challenges and foster the deepest and most powerful strategic dialogue. Overall, this is a highly exploratory, people focused team that will want to move fast in a highly entrepreneurial way with a strong focus on the commercial side of the business. It will often discuss things in a highly strategic and abstract manner and will benefit from a more detail-oriented, expertise driven perspective from time to time.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team demonstrates a strong customer-centric focus, with 64% of members scoring in the highest quartile for Attachment. This indicates a group that is deeply committed to understanding customer needs, building strong relationships, and ensuring their products and services align with market demands. However, this strong external orientation comes with a potential blind spot. The team has no members in the lowest quartile—associated with a strong content focus—and only two members with a moderate orientation toward product and technical considerations. As a result, there may be less attention paid to the product’s internal quality, feasibility, and long-term development. This could lead to over-prioritizing customer demands at the expense of internal priorities or product integrity. Additionally, the middle quartiles are underrepresented, suggesting that the team may struggle to balance external expectations with internal realities, such as operational constraints or technical limitations. To strengthen its overall effectiveness, the team could benefit from a slight rebalancing—either by: Bringing in members with a stronger product or technical focus, or Encouraging existing members to more actively consider internal feasibility and long-term product health. Overall, this is a highly customer-oriented team, but one that would benefit from greater diversity of perspective to ensure more balanced, sustainable decision-making.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team has a strong skew toward the higher end of the exploration dimension. Approximately 40% of the team scores in the top quartile, indicating a strong focus on exploration, innovation, and experimentation. These individuals are likely to be the ones driving new ideas and pushing the boundaries of what the team can achieve. Another 40% of the team scores in the middle two quartiles, suggesting some attention to operationalizing the ideas generated. These team members are likely to be able to see both sides of the argument and help bridge the gap between exploration and optimization. There are no people in the bottom quartile, however, indicating a lack of focus on optimization, efficiency, and execution. This will cause the team to run into challenges when it comes to implementing their ideas and generating maximum value from them. Overall, this distribution suggests a team that is strongly focused on and excited by new possibilities and opportunities whilst potentially not being as effective as possible when it comes to actually getting the most out of them.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team shows a clear imbalance in its ability to manage complexity, with a large portion of members scoring in the highest quartile, and no one scoring in the lowest — meaning there are no true specialists within the group. While some members fall within the middle range, the overall profile leans heavily toward a generalist orientation. This suggests the team is strong in seeing the bigger picture, connecting work across functions, and approaching challenges from multiple angles. These are valuable qualities, particularly in complex environments that require strategic thinking and coordination. However, the absence of specialist contributions presents a critical gap. Specialists bring deep, domain-specific knowledge, precision, and the ability to uncover nuanced insights — all of which are essential when complex challenges demand not just broad understanding, but also detailed, expert-driven solutions. Without this, the team may align well around what needs to be done, but lack the practical depth required to determine exactly how to do it, especially within specific technical or operational domains. To address this, the team would benefit from: Introducing more specialist perspectives, either through team composition or collaboration, and Creating space for those with deep expertise to contribute meaningfully and be heard. Balancing generalist and specialist thinking will help the team not only maintain strategic alignment, but also deepen its capacity to solve complex problems with rigor and domain-level clarity.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: This team shows a clear imbalance in quadrant distribution, with a strong concentration in the Relationship–Exploration quadrant and limited representation elsewhere. While this gives the team a clear strength, it also presents important gaps that could impact overall effectiveness.
The dominance of Relationship–Exploration means the team is highly skilled at generating new ideas and initiatives that focus on people — particularly in building and exploring relationships with customers, clients, and stakeholders. This is a valuable asset, especially in environments that require connection, engagement, and adaptability. However, only a small number of team members contribute to the Content–Exploration quadrant. This means that while there is some capability to drive innovation in products, services, or technical solutions, those voices risk being overshadowed by the dominant relationship-focused mindset. Without deliberate effort, valuable content-driven perspectives may not get the attention they deserve. The team is also underrepresented in both optimization quadrants. Only one member contributes to Relationship–Optimization, and none are present in Content–Optimization. This suggests a potential weakness in areas like refining ideas, maintaining consistent delivery, optimizing existing processes, and ensuring long-term relationship stability. To strengthen its overall effectiveness, the team could: Actively support and amplify the voices of those contributing to Content–Exploration, ensuring their input is visible and valued. Develop or bring in optimization-oriented contributions to help balance the team’s natural focus on exploration with more structure, delivery, and follow-through. With a more even distribution of perspectives, the team can better connect its creativity and relational strengths to consistent, outcome-driven results.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team shows a clear imbalance across the phases of the Business Performance Dialogue. It is strongly represented in the first phase, Changing with People, where new ideas are generated and change is initiated through engagement, inspiration, and energy. Team members in this phase are likely skilled at identifying opportunities, involving stakeholders, and creating forward momentum for transformation. However, there are only one or two contributors in the second phase, the Operational Core—the crucial space where ideas are translated into structured plans, coordination takes place, and day-to-day execution is aligned with strategic intent. With such limited presence in this phase, the team may struggle to connect the energy and vision from phase one to a shared operational direction, risking a breakdown between intent and action. The third phase, Structured Delivery, is completely unrepresented. This phase ensures long-term anchoring of change through systems, consistent delivery, and accountability. Without contributions here, there is a real risk that initiatives, even when well-intended and initially energized, may lose momentum or fail to sustain impact over time. This configuration suggests a team that excels at initiating and energizing change, but may encounter difficulty when it comes to building operational alignment and delivering consistent outcomes. To strengthen overall effectiveness, the team could: Support the few contributors in the Operational Core by building more shared capacity for coordination and structure, and Consider ways to develop or bring in delivery-focused perspectives to ensure that ideas not only start strong, but also finish well. Bridging these gaps would allow the team to move more fluidly from inspiration to execution, and ultimately, to sustainable performance.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is not currently well-positioned to engage in the full Safeguarding Innovation dialogue. Representation in the later phases is minimal, with just two members contributing to Phase 2: Operational Testing, and one to Phase 3: Sustaining with People. While these phases are essential for testing ideas and embedding them into the organization, the limited presence makes consistent follow-through challenging. More critically, the team has a complete gap in Phase 1: Inventive Exploration—the stage where new ideas are generated, innovation is sparked, and fresh thinking emerges. Without natural contributors in this area, the team may struggle to initiate innovation or challenge existing approaches. To address this, the team should first clarify whether Safeguarding Innovation is a strategic priority, and if so, define the outcomes that matter most. From there, it can assess whether existing members can stretch into the underrepresented phases—especially Inventive Exploration—or whether it would be more effective to bring in new perspectives. By building strength in the early phase, the team will be better equipped to generate innovative ideas, which can then be tested and sustained through its current, albeit limited, capabilities in the later phases.


Project: allsafe mt
Focus: Summary
Description: This team shows a clear emphasis on the Exploration and Content sides, with a slight generalist majority. The lower scores on Attachment suggest that the team is fact- and logic-driven, and possibly less focused on relationship-building. As a result, the team may be more task-oriented than people-oriented, with a tendency to prioritize results over relationships. There are a few contributors in the middle of this dimension—individuals who naturally connect the team’s content focus with more people- or customer-driven goals—but the vast majority score moderately to strongly on the content side. Most team members score high to very high on Exploration, indicating a strong focus on innovation, new ideas, and opportunity-seeking. Nearly 90% of members score above the 50th percentile on this dimension. This equips the team to think outside the box and effectively operationalize new ideas. However, challenges may arise when it comes to implementing and optimizing these initiatives—potentially leaving results on the table. Thanks to its spread across the Managing Complexity dimension, the team is well equipped to handle complex situations. This distribution makes the team highly suitable for addressing complex challenges by integrating expertise within a broader context. The team’s slight generalist tendency suggests a preference for strategic, high-level thinking across the whole system. However, there are enough specialists and bridge-builders present to ground, challenge, and execute these strategic visions effectively.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team demonstrates a strong focus on product development and technical content, with a clear orientation toward solutions. This is reflected in the fact that most team members score in the lowest quartile on the Attachment scale, indicating a strong product-driven mindset. However, this internal focus may come at the expense of understanding and prioritizing customer needs and market demands. To create more balance, the team could consciously place greater emphasis on the relational side of collaboration—such as communication, teamwork, and mutual support. Adding team members with higher Attachment scores could also help balance the profile and strengthen relationships, both within the team and with external stakeholders. That said, the team already has the potential to compensate for this imbalance by making good use of the contributions of members with slightly higher Attachment scores. These individuals can serve as valuable bridges between the team’s internal orientation and external customer insights. To improve alignment with customer needs, the team could encourage these members to take a more prominent role in customer interactions and feedback processes, especially if they are willing to stretch toward the people side. This would help foster a culture in which customer perspectives are actively integrated into product decisions.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team shows a clear preference for exploration, with a significant portion of members scoring high on the Exploration dimension. This indicates an innovative and experimental mindset, focused on discovering new solutions. With only one team member scoring lower on this dimension, the team may risk overlooking the value of optimization—such as process improvement, efficiency, and practical execution. While the strong exploratory orientation encourages forward-thinking and creative ideas, the lack of balance with optimization may lead to challenges in structuring, executing, and embedding those ideas. To address this, the team could consider bringing in members with a stronger focus on optimization or consciously adopt a more optimization-oriented approach during implementation phases. This would help ensure that ideas are not only generated, but also effectively developed, delivered, and sustained.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: The team is well-positioned to tackle complex challenges, with a strong and diverse distribution of members across the Managing Complexity dimension. Team members with a strong generalist orientation likely thrive on integrating ideas and navigating strategic, long-term thinking. Meanwhile, those with more average to specialist profiles tend to focus on depth, analytical work, and detailed execution. The team’s strength lies in combining these two perspectives—leveraging deep expertise while maintaining a broad view of the entire process. This integrated approach equips the team to handle complex problems effectively. That said, the team leans more toward the generalist side. To bring this into better balance, it could be helpful to involve members who gain energy from tackling clearly defined, technical challenges, or to make sure those perspectives are actively included in decision-making processes.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: The team is strongly represented in the Content-Exploration quadrant, with 62% of members falling into this category. This suggests a strong focus on developing new products and services and driving innovation. These team members are likely highly motivated and energetic, always seeking new challenges and opportunities. However, this dominance may lead to an overemphasis on exploration and innovation at the expense of other essential areas. The Relationship-Exploration quadrant is also represented and adds value in areas such as relationship building, market exploration, and customer engagement. These individuals are likely strong communicators and connectors, helping bridge the team with the external environment. However, there is a notable lack of presence in the Relationship-Optimization quadrant, which is crucial for maintaining relationships, ensuring customer satisfaction, and providing consistent service—both internally and externally. Without this perspective, the team may struggle to prioritize these relationship-sustaining activities. The Content-Optimization quadrant is similarly underrepresented, with only one team member. This may result in less focus on quality assurance, efficiency, and process sustainability. To create a more balanced and high-performing team, it would be beneficial to strengthen the underrepresented quadrants—either by bringing in new members with those qualities, developing existing team members through targeted training, or encouraging individuals to stretch into these areas.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: This team is strongly positioned in the middle phase of the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue—Operational Testing—with many members contributing naturally to this area. This provides a solid foundation for translating ideas into structured, practical solutions and ensuring strong execution. A substantial portion of the team is also situated near the first phase—Inventive Exploration—which focuses on identifying opportunities, generating innovative ideas, and responding to customer needs. While this suggests that the team has the potential to engage with innovation, it may lack the proactive drive to initiate change from within, relying instead on external stimuli to spark new directions. The main gap lies in the third phase—Sustaining with People—where only one team member is positioned. This phase is essential for embedding new solutions, maintaining alignment with stakeholders, and ensuring long-term adoption and continuity. Without stronger representation here, the team risks losing momentum after testing and delivery.To ensure that innovation is not only developed and executed but also sustained, the team could encourage members to stretch into this final phase or bring in new contributors who naturally focus on implementation, adoption, and long-term integration. Strengthening this area would help the team carry ideas through to lasting impact.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team is in a strong position to cover the first two phases of the Safeguarding Innovation Dialogue: Inventive Exploration and Operational Testing. The Inventive Exploration phase is where innovation begins—focused on generating new ideas, exploring opportunities, and responding creatively to emerging needs. Team members in this phase are typically energized by discovery and experimentation. The Operational Testing phase, where the team is particularly strong, is centered on turning those ideas into practical, structured solutions—testing feasibility, applying discipline, and ensuring clarity and focus around outcomes. However, there are no team members who naturally contribute to the third phase, Sustaining with People. This final phase is crucial for embedding innovations within the organization, aligning stakeholders, and maintaining momentum over time. It ensures that tested ideas take root and deliver sustained value. The absence of natural contributors in this area may lead to promising initiatives losing traction after initial development and testing. To address this, the team could assign specific roles focused on continuity and implementation, or collaborate with individuals outside the team who naturally operate in this phase. Doing so will help ensure that innovations are not only created and tested but also effectively integrated and carried forward.


Project: allsafe directie team
Focus: Summary
Description: This team shows a focus on the content side, is somewhat clustered toward Exploration, and is well distributed along the Managing Complexity dimension. On the Attachment dimension, the team demonstrates a strong emphasis on the content end, indicating a group that is highly task-, result-, and efficiency-oriented. This focus supports a productive and goal-driven approach. However, there is a notable absence of team members on the people-oriented side—only one contribution scores just above the midpoint. This imbalance may lead to insufficient attention to customer needs, team dynamics, and interpersonal communication. As a result, the team risks overlooking the importance of relationship-building and customer orientation, which could negatively impact collaboration and stakeholder alignment. On the Exploration dimension, the team shows a relatively balanced distribution, with a slight leaning toward Exploration. This suggests that the team enjoys exploring new ideas and opportunities, while also having the capacity to translate them into structured plans and processes—supported by the two team members positioned in the operational core. This provides a solid foundation for innovation and development, as long as the team remains mindful of follow-through and efficiency. On the Managing Complexity dimension, the team is clearly split: half of the members score highly generalist, while the other half fall into the mid-specialist range. This creates a dynamic foundation for balancing broad, strategic thinking with more detail-oriented execution. It suggests the team is well equipped to handle complex challenges due to its cognitive diversity. However, the absence of members positioned between these two ends highlights a potential gap in bridging perspectives. To address this, the team could explore ways to strengthen cohesion and collaboration across this dimension—for example, by fostering mutual understanding and teamwork between specialist and generalist contributors.

Focus: Product-Market-Fit
Description: This team is predominantly positioned on the content side of the Attachment dimension, with most members scoring in the mid-range. This indicates a team that is largely focused on technical development, internal processes, and product features, while still maintaining some awareness of customer needs and stakeholder dynamics. One team member shows a moderately stronger focus on relationships, which provides a useful bridge between content and customer perspectives. However, the overall absence of high Attachment scores suggests that customer-centric thinking may not be a natural strength within the team. To strengthen this area, the team could consider encouraging more explicit focus on relationship-building and user needs, or adding members with a naturally stronger orientation toward the people side. This would help ensure that product decisions are consistently informed by both technical insight and real-world customer context.

Focus: Speed-to-Market
Description: This team shows a well-balanced distribution between exploration and optimization, with a slight leaning toward the exploration side—indicating a natural openness to new ideas and innovative thinking. One team member scores very high on Exploration (above 75), likely serving as a catalyst for forward-thinking and experimentation. On the other end, one member scores low (below 25), providing valuable counterbalance by emphasizing practicality, efficiency, and timely delivery. Two other team members are positioned in the middle, helping bridge the gap between bold innovation and operational execution. Their presence adds balance and flexibility, allowing the team to translate ideas into action while keeping both ambition and feasibility in view. While no team members fall into the later stages of operational optimization—where refinement and long-term process embedding take place—the team’s strong representation in the early stages suggests it is well equipped to generate ideas and begin executing them effectively. To sustain long-term impact, however, it may benefit from additional support in embedding and optimizing solutions over time.

Focus: Strategic Agility Index 
Description: This team demonstrates a strong capacity to tackle complex challenges, thanks to its broad distribution along the vertical axis. Half of the members score highly generalist, indicating a strategic orientation, long-term thinking, and the ability to oversee processes from a broad contextual perspective. The other half scores in the mid-to-specialist range, reflecting the ability to dive into detail and bring analytical depth. This balance enables the team to effectively integrate expertise with a capacity for connecting people and ideas—key to managing complexity. However, the absence of members in the lowest quartile suggests the team may be less anchored in the present, as most members naturally adopt a broader focus. To mitigate this, the team could benefit from adding members with a more grounded, specialist mindset, or by encouraging current members to become more aware of this potential blind spot and take steps to actively address it.

Focus: Strategic Hire Analysis 
Description: Half of the team is positioned in the Content-Exploration quadrant, which is characterized by a strong focus on technical innovation, productivity, and a drive to achieve results. The People-Exploration quadrant—equally focused on innovation and opportunity—adds a relational dimension, emphasizing people and stakeholder engagement. With members in both these exploratory quadrants, the team is well equipped to pursue new ideas while maintaining an eye on customer and stakeholder impact. A contribution in the Content-Optimization quadrant brings important strengths around structure, monitoring, and process embedding. However, the complete absence of members in the People-Optimization quadrant presents a potential risk. This quadrant plays a vital role in sustaining customer relationships, fostering employee engagement, and maintaining internal harmony—areas that are critical for long-term success but may be overlooked in a team that leans heavily toward exploration and content. To address this gap, the team might consider adding someone with strengths in People-Optimization or deliberately assigning roles and responsibilities to ensure that relationship management and internal cohesion are not neglected.

Focus: Business Performance
Description: In this team, one member is positioned clearly in the first phase of the Business Performance Dialogue, bringing valuable insight into customer needs, new opportunities, and innovative ideas. Two other members are close to the second phase and, with a slight stretch toward the operational core, can translate ideas into actionable plans. The fourth team member is located in the content-focused optimization quadrant and contributes by ensuring structure, efficiency, and the embedding of processes. The strength of this team lies in its diversity across the phases of the Business Performance Dialogue. However, this diversity requires intentional coordination and open communication to ensure that each contribution is recognized and effectively integrated. To strengthen the team’s foundation in the first phase—centered on people, innovation, and high exploration—it may be beneficial to add a team member with a stronger natural orientation toward that phase. This would help maintain balance and ensure that customer needs and early-stage innovation are continuously represented.

Focus: Safeguarding Innovation
Description: This team shows a score distribution that leans toward the innovative and experimental phase, indicating a strong capacity for generating new ideas and exploring creative solutions. However, there are no team members positioned in the second phase—Operational Testing—which focuses on translating ideas into practical applications through structured testing and refinement. This suggests limited capacity for efficient execution and process embedding. In addition, the team lacks representation in the third phase of the Safeguarding Innovation dialogue—Sustaining with People—which is essential for anchoring innovations, maintaining stakeholder alignment, and ensuring long-term impact. This creates a potential risk: while the team may excel at ideation, it may struggle to move from concept to implementation and sustainable delivery. As it stands, the team is not fully equipped to carry ideas through the complete innovation cycle. To address this, the team could benefit from adding members who naturally contribute to the second and third phases, or by clearly assigning roles to existing members to cover these areas. This would help ensure that promising ideas are not only developed, but also effectively implemented and embedded within the organization.
